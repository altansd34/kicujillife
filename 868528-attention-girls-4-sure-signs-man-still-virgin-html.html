So, can you really tell if the man you date is a virgin or not? These signs will help you to settle this matter.
Sign #1: his behavior
Surely, the easiest thing to do is just to ask him, but would he tell the truth?"><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Well, that’s an interesting question to ask, but a hard one to answer. Surely, female virginity is much easier to detect. But can you do that with men?</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.onthe.io/chncdhaHR0cHM6Ly93aWtyLmNvbS93cC1jb250ZW50L3VwbG9hZHMvMjAxNi8wNi9hdHRlbnRpb24tZ2lybHMtNC1zdXJlLXNpZ25zLW1hbi1zdGlsbC12aXJnaW5fNDFiNDg0NTU1YzU1OGY3ZGQ1ZWI5MmU0MDNkMjlkZDEuanBn.prx.40b1b5d1.jpg><p>So, can you really tell if the man you date is a virgin or not? These signs will help you to settle this matter.</p><p><strong>Sign #1: his behavior</strong></p><p>Surely, the easiest thing to do is just to ask him, but would he tell the truth? Who knows! So, if you have not had sex with the pal yet, just watch his behavior. Look for the ways he handles other women or you. If he still had no sex in his life, the guy would be shyer with the girls.</p><p>When you kiss and make out, he would do some awkward moves and would be eager, but hesitant to touch you in the hottest spots.</p><p><strong>Sign #2: run a test on him</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.onthe.io/chncdhaHR0cHM6Ly93aWtyLmNvbS93cC1jb250ZW50L3VwbG9hZHMvMjAxNi8wNi9hdHRlbnRpb24tZ2lybHMtNC1zdXJlLXNpZ25zLW1hbi1zdGlsbC12aXJnaW5fZjZhNjljOTFkZTk2NzhlNDFiMjIxZTQ1ZmE3ZDU1NjkuanBn.prx.751bb780.jpg><p>Get him to meet you at some private place, where you can start experimenting. Introduce an unexpected change of plan and make it a little hot for him. Start making out and go one step further. No, you do not have actually to have sex with the fellow. Just head in that direction to see, what he does.</p><p>Virgin guys would be pretty excited, but uncomfortable with the situation. He may either slow down or try to rush things in a pretty clumsy way. You would surely know the guy lacks the skill and experience.</p><p><strong>Sign #3: can he get your bra off?</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.onthe.io/chncdhaHR0cHM6Ly93aWtyLmNvbS93cC1jb250ZW50L3VwbG9hZHMvMjAxNi8wNi9hdHRlbnRpb24tZ2lybHMtNC1zdXJlLXNpZ25zLW1hbi1zdGlsbC12aXJnaW5fNjU1MTU4Y2FmZWNiNmExOWIwYzUxM2JmM2VhMzA2ZWMuanBn.prx.107b7c6b.jpg><p>That’s funny, but a sure sign of male virginity. If he has never dealt with the bra clip, he won’t be able to take it off, or it would take him a long while to do so.</p><p><strong>Sign #4: his male organ</strong></p><p>There is one sign to look for. Men, who have never had sex, may have trouble inserting their penis into your vagina. Why not only because they are inexperienced. The foreskin on the penis may sit too tight on it. When the man goes in, it should stretch out and be tugged back. However, if he never had sex before, it may cause pain or even break down with some minor bleeding.</p><p>Surely, most guys “massage” their male organs and stretch the skin, but some don’t, and that’s an obvious sign of their virility.</p><p>Surly, honest relationships are the best. But many men are shy of being a virgin and owning it up. They wish to be cool and attractive for you. So, if you catch a virgin at lying to you, just be nice to him and enjoy.</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkhXeElGtvZpmkqbKvwMiopWafmae5tHmTZqquqpViwKqzzaxkppmeYsC1tculZK%2Bhopy2r3rHraSl</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

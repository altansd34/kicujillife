Apparently, fans think that this is the model’s subtle indication that she’s calling it quits with the singer.</p><p>“Ms Bieberrr what the drama is??” one user wrote.</p><p>“Soo are they divorced or,” another person commented.</p><a title=@haileybieber href=# rel=noopener>@haileybieber</a><p>exactly</p><a title="♬ original sound - Kam Tunechi 💕" href=# rel=noopener>♬ original sound – Kam Tunechi 💕</a><p>Ahead of the TikTok post, some fans have already been speculating about the real status of Hailey and Justin’s marriage. Their recent outing in Beverly Hills further fueled the rumors after the couple was spotted unusually distant from each other.</p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Hailey and Justin</a> spent their Sunday morning breakfast in the said city, but they don’t seem in a happy mood. They were also walking a feet apart, which made fans think that they’re struggling in their relationship.</p><p>Furthermore, the supermodel spent her holiday apart from her husband as seen in her New Year post. The Rhode CEO posted pictures of herself while she’s on the beach. Along with her during the tropical getaway are her friends, including supermodel Kendall Jenner.</p><p>“Excuse me, where’s the Justin and Hailey New Year’s pic? It’s literally y’all’s brand,” a person wrote.</p><p>“Where’s Justin?” another person asked. “Divorce coming? Cause you both are acting shady.”</p><p>Despite ongoing rumors, neither Hailey nor Justin have directly addressed the rumors.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-she-is-allegedly-tired-of-her-immature-and-needy-husband>She is Allegedly Tired of Her “Immature” and “Needy” Husband</h2><p>In other news, an insider close to the couple claimed that their marriage is indeed on the rocks. Allegedly, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Justin Bieber</a> doesn’t act like a husband at all due to his childish attitude.</p><p>“He acts like a needy kid all the time and she’s constantly having to apologize for him and try to get him to act like an adult,” a source told Radar.</p><p>Moreover, the insider claimed that the socialite is already done with his “needy kid tendencies” and “immature behavior.” Hailey reportedly realized this when she felt confounded after they attended a promotional event for Rhode.</p><p>“[Their marriage is] based on Justin’s childish needs and it’s doomed,” another source divulged, according to the National Enquirer. “They got married very young and didn’t know what they were getting into, and it’s been up and down ever since.”</p><p>The couple met in 2009 and dated in secret for a few years before having a public split in 2016. It pays to note that the “Yummy” singer was involved in an on-again-off-again romance with Selena Gomez ahead of his relationship with his current wife. In July 2018, Justin and Hailey got engaged and they tied the knot two months after. &nbsp;</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Original_JasonAldean_LukeBryan_Denise-TruscelloGetty-Images-for-ACM-220x147.jpeg alt="Luke Bryan, Jason Aldean Went on a Road Trip, Dairy Queen Stop After Plane Makes Emergency Landing" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>hailey bieber</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>Justin Bieber</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57xZqlrGWknbavt4yjrKysmaN6o7XEm5yrZZiWtq2x2GaZop2Smr9urdGeZKCdpKm2r7OMmmSdoaakv6SxjKGcq52jYsSpxY4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

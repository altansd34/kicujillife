However, some fans apparently didn’t understand the joke, so Poppe had to clear things up.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-maddie-poppe-writes-herself-a-fake-love-letter>Maddie Poppe Writes Herself a Fake Love Letter</h2><p>On Monday, Poppe posted an Instagram story sharing that she had received a package from the Des Moines Airport containing a skincare product that was confiscated. She then pulled a note out of the box which was supposedly from “TSA David.”</p><p>The note apologized for the “hurt & heartache I’ve caused you.” It went on to suggest that everyone should stream her song “Peace of Mind,” calling it “the best song I ever heard in my whole life.” The note ended by telling Poppe she’s “the hottest girl in the world.”</p><p>You might think it was pretty obvious that the note had been written by Poppe herself, especially since she linked to her song on the story. Those who follow the singer will also know that she likes to take a funny approach to sharing life updates.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: </strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>‘AMERICAN IDOL’ WINNER MADDIE POPPE RELEASES NEW SONG ‘PEACE OF MIND’</strong></a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-she-explains-the-joke-to-confused-fans>She Explains the Joke to Confused Fans</h2><p>A few hours after posting the fake love note, Poppe shared an update, writing, “I thought it was pretty obvious the love note was complete satire, but I’ve gotten way too many concerned messages.” She clarified that she was the one to write the note.</p><p>Poppe went on to write that “if you genuinely thought that was real, we have a lot to learn about each other.” She added, “Nothing is real. I’m not real. This whole thing is just a joke. Everything is a joke. Life is way too heavy for me to ever be serious.”</p><p>She went on to address some of the more specific messages she received about the note, clarifying that the TSA worker doesn’t know her address. She even confirmed that she bought herself a new bottle of skincare.</p><p>Poppe ended the post by writing that “he and I are actually getting married and we have a baby on the way.” Hopefully she doesn’t have to clear up that joke, too.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Valchmerkovskiy_baby-220x147.jpg alt="‘DWTS’ Pro Jenna Johnson Releases First Video of Her Newborn Baby" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>American Idol</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>maddie poppe</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57yJ2mpWWnnruvsdFmpJqclJ6ybrzOqaeeZaentrWx0mafnqqjmrmnecBmnZqjlWK5sMLEZqWorJVis6K60mabqKakYrSmwIytn55lmqS4pns%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

Meet Alex Aspasia, a&nbsp;plus-size model who inspires many with her unapologetic self-love and confidence. Despite hurtful comments, she has managed to&nbsp;rise above the negativity and focus on&nbsp;the positive aspects of&nbsp;her life. But that’s not all&nbsp;— she has also found love and recently made it&nbsp;public with her husband.</p><p><h2>One date refused to&nbsp;hold her hand publicly.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/40e/431/fb17ea5d5393d778ff10b413c8.jpg><p>Alex has faced a&nbsp;difficult journey towards self-love. In&nbsp;the past, she endured being hidden away by&nbsp;the men she once dated, with one even shying away from holding her hand in&nbsp;public due to&nbsp;her being plus-sized. These hurtful experiences left her feeling undeserving, inadequate, and devoid of&nbsp;beauty.</p><p>She <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a>, “I&nbsp;used to&nbsp;see people who <strong>wanted to&nbsp;keep me&nbsp;a&nbsp;secret</strong>. <strong>Another refused to&nbsp;hold my&nbsp;hand in&nbsp;public</strong> because&nbsp;I was plus-sized. It&nbsp;made me&nbsp;feel unworthy. Not good enough. Not beautiful. I&nbsp;hit that low, and&nbsp;I remember thinking&nbsp;— ’I’ll never let anyone let me&nbsp;feel that way again.’”</p><p><h2>Her husband showers her with love and affection.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5fc/f30/c76a9d5d9c9cd99bfc9bc9ba0d.jpg><p>Now, she has proudly shared her <a href=# title=relationship data-link=tag>relationship</a> with her new beau with the world. The couple’s <a href=# title=TikTok data-link=tag>TikTok</a> <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>clips</a> showcase their affection for each other with cuddles, loving gazes, and sweet kisses on&nbsp;the lips. It’s a&nbsp;heartwarming display of&nbsp;love that reminds&nbsp;us all that size should never be&nbsp;a&nbsp;barrier to&nbsp;finding someone special.</p><p><h2>They met on&nbsp;a&nbsp;dating app.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/647/c45/9afb7e5c9abe89052bb1f6d2fd.jpg><p>Alex Aspasia’s journey to&nbsp;finding love has been nothing short of&nbsp;remarkable. In&nbsp;the summer of&nbsp;2019, she met her <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>now-husband</a>, Matthew, a&nbsp;digital marketer, on&nbsp;a&nbsp;dating app. And the two instantly hit it&nbsp;off. Their connection was so&nbsp;strong that they decided to&nbsp;tie the knot in&nbsp;April 2022, solidifying their love and commitment to&nbsp;each other.</p><p><h2>Trolls called her husband “desperate”.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/039/dcd/e370825ce8b61bcb4fea235e0e.jpg><p>However, their love story hasn’t been without its challenges. Alex has faced her fair share of&nbsp;body-shaming and negative comments as&nbsp;a&nbsp;plus-sized model. Strangers on&nbsp;the internet have told her that she will “crush his legs” and that he&nbsp;is&nbsp;“desperate” to&nbsp;be&nbsp;with her. But despite these hurtful remarks, the couple remains smitten and unfazed by&nbsp;the negativity.</p><p>“It’s horrible. But we&nbsp;are 100 percent smitten with each other. I&nbsp;know my&nbsp;worth now. Just because you are overweight or&nbsp;plus-sized, it&nbsp;doesn’t mean you don’t deserve love. I&nbsp;want people to&nbsp;know you are worthy.”</p><p><h2>The progress she has achieved would fill her younger self with immense pride and admiration.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/0e5/18d/26db71541290a88d83bd7d8a6c.jpg><p>Despite the cruel comments she receives online, this size 26&nbsp;model has learned to&nbsp;love showing off her body. Reflecting on&nbsp;her journey, she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>remarks</a>, “<strong>If&nbsp;you would have told younger me&nbsp;I would publicly be&nbsp;in&nbsp;a&nbsp;bikini at&nbsp;my&nbsp;size&nbsp;I never would have believed you</strong>.”</p><p>Unfortunately, her detractors have prompted her to&nbsp;cover up&nbsp;in&nbsp;the past, with her remarking that “<strong>My&nbsp;mum, she didn’t force&nbsp;me, but&nbsp;I had to&nbsp;wear those really ugly one-pieces, covering up&nbsp;as&nbsp;much as&nbsp;I&nbsp;can</strong>.”</p><p>“It’s okay to&nbsp;embrace your belly, big thighs, big arms&nbsp;— it’s there, it’s not going anywhere, it’s hot outside, and&nbsp;<strong>I don’t want to&nbsp;be&nbsp;in&nbsp;triple layers</strong>.”</p><p><h2>She knows how to&nbsp;stand up&nbsp;to&nbsp;body shaming.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/4c9/391/33e8c15ad59ad022f499dbaf90.jpg><p>Alex has faced relentless criticism and body shaming online. She remembers how hurtful it&nbsp;was to&nbsp;be&nbsp;called a&nbsp;“<strong>beach whale</strong>,” sarcastically remarking, “They’re like ’spotted the beach whale.’ I’m like, ’That’s original, at&nbsp;least come up&nbsp;with something good.’”</p><p>Unfortunately, the negativity doesn’t stop there, as&nbsp;others assert that big women shouldn’t show their bodies, deeming big bellies “disgusting”. However, Alex stands proud of&nbsp;her body, recognizing that “<strong>This is&nbsp;a&nbsp;real woman’s body, real women have cellulite, stretch marks, rolls</strong>.”</p><p><h2>She encourages plus-size women to&nbsp;never shy away from putting on&nbsp;their favorite bikini.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/cbc/bcc/b8857652e1b7460daba68299d6.jpg><p>She passionately encourages others to&nbsp;embrace their bodies and celebrate their journeys toward self-acceptance. She firmly believes that anyone who is&nbsp;considering wearing a&nbsp;bikini for the first time should go&nbsp;for&nbsp;it, whether it’s in&nbsp;the privacy of&nbsp;their own home or&nbsp;in&nbsp;their backyard. She asserts, “<strong>Put it&nbsp;on, and just know your body is&nbsp;worthy&nbsp;— get it&nbsp;out</strong>.”</p><p>Alex realizes the significance of&nbsp;her actions and the impact she has on&nbsp;others, particularly women who share her body type. She exclaims, “<strong>Women who look like&nbsp;me, they feel like they can put that bikini on&nbsp;now after seeing me&nbsp;in&nbsp;it, that’s what’s important</strong>.”</p><p>While we&nbsp;come to&nbsp;the end of&nbsp;this touching journey filled with love and acceptance, a&nbsp;new chapter unfolds. Join&nbsp;us in&nbsp;this forthcoming segment as&nbsp;a&nbsp;plus-size model courageously addresses the hurtful sentiments that her partner is&nbsp;“<a href=#>out of&nbsp;her league</a>.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZL2mu8%2BlnGavkaPBprCMraZmo5WavW65xGaYZquVmL%2BmwIypo66rXai2u7GMsKammZ6oequ71KulnrFdqbxuuM6vnGaZnpl6oq%2FCnqetmZ6Ysm6EkG1rcG9f</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

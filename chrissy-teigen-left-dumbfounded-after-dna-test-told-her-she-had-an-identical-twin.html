She subsequently showed her family tree with a little circle to her initials.</p><p>“The first thing that came up after I found out that I was part neanderthal, was this: Identical twin,” she said. “That has to be a joke, right?”</p><p>She continued and stated that she texted her doctor upon seeing the result and went far as asking her father to confirm her mother’s labor story.</p><p>“I’m literally saying, ‘Dad, hey, did you see come out of mom’s vagina and were there two of me?’ she stated. “He starts laughing, saying ‘No, I was there, there are not two of you!’ I was like, ‘Are you sure you were there?’”</p><p>Yet, her father’s memory failed to convince her allegations. Afterwards, the professional model called her sister, who she noted to have gasped when she heard the question.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-she-found-out-her-identical-twin-was-herself>She Found Out Her Identical Twin was Herself</h2><p>According to Teigen, at that point, she has already made excuses for her “whole life.” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">John Legend</a>’s wife was evidently confused and bewildered by the result of the DNA genetic test.</p><p>“I’m like, ‘This is why I’m so co-dependent, because my twin was ripped away from me! This is why I always felt something missing and this is why I have addiction issues,'” she said.</p><p>However, her sister mentioned Finding Your Roots, a PBS show she participated in that didn’t air. This show attempted to dive deeper into a celebrity’s ancestry.</p><p>“They had us take DNA tests, and they put it under secret names so the world couldn’t tell,” she said. “My identical twin was myself. I was matching myself.”</p><p>Thankfully, the issue has been cleared: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Chrissy Teigen</a> has no lost identical twin but herself. Props to her sister for uncovering the truth.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Original_RuPaul_Jerod-HarrisWireImage-220x147.jpeg alt="RuPaul Charles Shares Advice On How to Deal With Haters" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>chrissy teigen</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>identical twin</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57wqGpoqujrnq1scignKdlnJqztXnDrqSbnp%2Bqu6Wxw2aYn6yVp3qlusBmq56rpGLBsLjDZp%2Beql2otaZ5x5qbZpmeYralsc2toJyZnGLBuLXNaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

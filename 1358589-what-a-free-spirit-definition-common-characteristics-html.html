I tell the truth, and I like to mix it up.”<i> – Ed Rendell</i></li><li>“I can entertain. I am a party girl. I am a free spirit.” <i>– Kendra Wilkinson</i></li><li>“I have fallen in love with the imagination. And if you fall in love with the imagination, you understand that it is a free spirit. It will go anywhere, and it can do anything.” <i>– Alice Walker</i></li><li>“A free spirit is not bound by this, that, matter, materialism or opinion. They sing, dance and flow on the wind — for they are at one with it. They are nothing and everything — void and expanse. Even space and time does not confine or define them. For they are pure energy itself.” <i>– Rasheed Ogunlaru</i></li><li>“I am a free spirit. I am very impulsive. I put the most trust in people chance after chance, regardless of how they treat me.”<i> – Sasha Lane</i></li><li>“I’m a human, and I’m multidimensional. If I was the perfect form of anything, I’d be boring. If I was a free spirit all the time, I would be boring; I would lack depth. If I was dark and enigmatic all the time, then I would lack relatability.” <i>– Halsey</i></li><li>“They can’t chain my spirit! My spirit runs free! Walls can’t contain it! Laws can’t restrain it! Authority has no power over it!” <i>– Bill Watterson</i></li><li>“The only way to deal with an unfree world is to become so absolutely free that your very existence is an act of rebellion.”<i> – Albert Camus</i></li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/74517fe8cf2ae226.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>The best be kind quotes to start your day with</span></p></a><p class=align-left>A free spirit is an interesting individual. They live by their own rules, and it's hard not to admire them and their confidence. They are true gems. Just like Simeon Rice said, <i>“I am a free spirit. A spirit that evolves. I’m a diamond. I’m just refining it. Polishing it. Glossing it up.”</i></p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>What is a Sigma male: Definition, traits, examples, famous sigmas</p><p class=align-left>As reported by Legit.ng, Sigma males are defined as rule breakers and makers.

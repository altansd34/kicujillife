Bright Side would like to offer some advice that might help parents better understand a sensitive child’s heavy emotions.
1. Be empathetic and talk to them."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

It&nbsp;can be&nbsp;exhausting but very rewarding once their methods start paying off.</p><p><strong>Bright Side </strong>would like to&nbsp;offer some advice that might help parents better understand a&nbsp;sensitive child’s heavy <a href=# title=emotions data-link=tag>emotions</a>.</p><p><h2>1. Be&nbsp;empathetic and talk to&nbsp;them.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/74b/9be/96a2915257b783772bf23169c4.jpg><p>If&nbsp;your child has emotional flare-ups in&nbsp;public, don’t try to&nbsp;suppress their <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>feelings</a> by&nbsp;telling them to&nbsp;stop whining. Accept those emotions and talk to&nbsp;your child about them. Sit next to&nbsp;them and <strong>try to&nbsp;understand why they are feeling the way they&nbsp;do</strong>, but don’t try to&nbsp;offer a&nbsp;quick solution. What you can do&nbsp;is&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>teach</a> them how to&nbsp;work with their emotions when they are in&nbsp;public so&nbsp;they don’t create uncomfortable situations.</p><p><h2>2. Let them know that expressing emotions is&nbsp;okay.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/1b1/376/29dba15c7393f0cdf3fe8fe1e6.jpg><p>Many parents will drag their kids to&nbsp;somewhere private if&nbsp;they start crying and creating a&nbsp;scene out in&nbsp;public. By&nbsp;doing this, the child feels like their <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>emotions</a> aren’t important and that they are doing something wrong. Instead of&nbsp;doing that, you can sit there with them, recognize their emotions, and let them know it’s okay. <strong>Try to&nbsp;connect with them</strong> and show that you support them instead of&nbsp;acting like what people think is&nbsp;all that matters to&nbsp;you.</p><p><h2>3. Point out their “wrong look” and suggest alternatives.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e97/10e/881434551c80984f43b8704a5b.jpg><p>Highly sensitive kids might be&nbsp;<strong>turning other kids off with their expressions</strong> without even realizing&nbsp;it. So&nbsp;it&nbsp;is&nbsp;important that parents <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>demonstrate</a> what that expression looks like. Your kid needs to&nbsp;know what they look like when they get upset or&nbsp;annoyed by&nbsp;someone. This may distress them at&nbsp;first, but it&nbsp;could have great results if&nbsp;you keep on&nbsp;doing&nbsp;it.</p><p>The second step would be&nbsp;for parents to&nbsp;offer alternative reactions. Let them know that if&nbsp;some other kid annoys them, they can just walk away or&nbsp;<strong>take a&nbsp;long deep breath</strong>. Counting to&nbsp;10&nbsp;might also help them remove themselves from the unpleasant situation and regulate their feelings.</p><p><h2>4. Be&nbsp;patient and give them their “alone” time.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/919/1f3/ca0bc15013ab6385dc82fdf932.jpg><p>Many parents rush to&nbsp;take their kids to&nbsp;multiple activities once they enter kindergarten. However, a&nbsp;sensitive child <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>dislikes</a> big crowds of&nbsp;kids and loud activities and <strong>prefers to&nbsp;stay at&nbsp;home more</strong>. You can spend more one-on-one time with them reading and playing whatever games make them happy. Don’t worry about their socializing since what’s more important for them at&nbsp;this point is&nbsp;to&nbsp;feel validated and accepted.</p><p><h2>5. Slowly help them overcome their fears.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/61e/89b/7fc87c59cca7e33a84b6619b09.jpg><p>Doing something a&nbsp;bit frightening is&nbsp;a&nbsp;way for a&nbsp;child to&nbsp;overcome their <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>fears</a>. However, this is&nbsp;a&nbsp;very delicate process that should be&nbsp;done gradually and with great sensitivity. It’s amazing how <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>fast</a> kids get over their fears once the right method has been used. However, you need to&nbsp;make sure that the <strong>child doesn’t feel like this is&nbsp;a&nbsp;punishment</strong> because they did something wrong.</p><p><h2>6. Getting a&nbsp;pet might help a&nbsp;lot.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/065/811/f4828556b8a616d026d8760deb.jpg><p>Pets have been <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>proven</a> to&nbsp;be&nbsp;the perfect companions for highly sensitive children. This is&nbsp;because pet animals are usually just as&nbsp;sensitive and compassionate as&nbsp;them. Because of&nbsp;this, <strong>it’s way easier for kids to&nbsp;connect with a&nbsp;furry friend</strong> than with a&nbsp;human friend that can negatively stimulate their emotions. For them, the connection with an&nbsp;animal can offer the understanding they need in&nbsp;a&nbsp;world that seems overwhelming to&nbsp;them.</p><p><h2>7. Create safe spaces around your house.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/6f7/ad4/5c114b5c5b82c5f298f5ae8eb2.jpg><p>Sensitive kids are way more receptive to&nbsp;their environment and get agitated quite easily. This is&nbsp;why it’s important that you create a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>safe space</a> in&nbsp;your home where they can process their emotions. This can be&nbsp;a&nbsp;spot where they’re able to&nbsp;do&nbsp;all their preferred activities, or&nbsp;their bedroom, where they can lie down and have you read a&nbsp;story to&nbsp;them. Make them feel like <strong>they can use their safe space whenever</strong> they feel like they need to&nbsp;take a&nbsp;break.</p><p><h2>8. Be&nbsp;very gentle with your methods of&nbsp;discipline.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/6bc/1e9/a42c9e553d986107fe6862e1a7.jpg><p>Your kid probably has a&nbsp;strong sense of&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>morality</a> and will call you out if&nbsp;you act hypocritically. They will also judge themselves harshly if&nbsp;they don’t comply with the rules that you’ve set in&nbsp;your home. That’s why <strong>you have to&nbsp;create limits and boundaries</strong> that apply to&nbsp;everyone in&nbsp;your house. Avoid being judgmental and make sure that consequences are fair and are applied to&nbsp;every member of&nbsp;your family.</p><p>Have you noticed any of&nbsp;the above characteristics in&nbsp;your child?

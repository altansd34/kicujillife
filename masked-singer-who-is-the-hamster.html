He says he’s usually “jumping from one project to the next with my famous friends.”</p><p>We see a red fish in a case. The camera then pans to a poster of Alcatraz Island.

He predicts Hamster may be Bill Murray or Brendan Fraser. Jenny chimes in to guess Albert Brooks, Tim Allen, Kelsey Grammer, or Andy Richter. Nicole says he’s “gotta be a comedian,” suggesting it might be Jack Black under the mask.</p><p>People on social media are also thinking that Nicole may be right and it’s Jack Black. Other popular guesses are Seth Rogen, Kevin Hart, Rob Schneider, and Rick Astley.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=block-dbd3758a-2c07-4407-884a-af68d22f49c4>Who is The Hamster on The Masked Singer?</h2><p>After some expert clue research and watching videos of comedians singing, we’ve definitely got this one figured out!

That voice is spot on!</p><p>The clues all make sense for Rob Schneider too. The stars decorating his cage could all be referencing his star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. The fish is a nod to the iconic scene in Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo where he crashed a fish tank.</p><p>Hamster mentions “jumping from one project to the next with my famous friends,” which is obviously talking about Adam Sandler, Chris Rock, and David Spade, with whom he’s done multiple projects.</p><p>The poster of Alcatraz Island also lines up with Rob Schneider, because he’s from San Francisco. Hamster mentioned being in “all different kinds of arenas” too, and Schneider is an actor, comedian, screenwriter, and director.</p><p>Finally, the two locker clues point to Schneider as well. The baseball is because he used to play baseball, and because he was in the movie Benchwarmers about a baseball team. And the stuffed strawberry I take to be a subtle hint at his history of winning Razzies. Gotta laugh at yourself, I guess!</p><p id=block-b059d09d-9b41-40c0-a5c4-c7c0ffec307f>Do you agree with our prediction? Or are there any clues we missed?

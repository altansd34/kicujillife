And with some of the most well-known stars ever revealed on the show already, we have plenty more to go! Grandpa Monster, like many other costumes this season, seems to be trying to throw us off. We expected an older celebrity, but this is clearly someone young.</strong></p><p id=block-8cd58f3a-f40d-4cb7-a343-93e1db5313c1>So who is Grandpa Monster? And is the “Grandpa” bit a ploy, or is it really someone older? We’ve got all the clues lined up to make our big prediction here!</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhepQ_8mneA</p>The Masked Singer Grandpa Monster clues and performance from the Season 5 Group B Premiere</figure><h4 class=wp-block-heading id=block-bba56fdc-1613-4f63-a943-7d4ef6fb3cee>Clues on The Masked Singer Season 5</h4><p>Grandpa Monster’s clues are on a beach. He says “reflecting on my long life, I can’t believe the troublemaking fool I was as a youngster.” We see a flashback of Grandpa Monster karate chopping a dictionary at school. He was “always acting out to get all eyes” on him. The classroom has a chalkboard with a “6” written on it in what looks like a football play, made of X’s and O’s.</p><p id=block-826093eb-7e1a-4dd7-a946-3dce54548dda><strong>RELATED: <a href=#>THE MASKED SINGER SEASON 5 GROUP B PREMIERE RECAP</a></strong></p><p>A teacher pulled him aside after class though and made him see he was “smarter than the character [he] was playing.” His teacher holds up a test with “97%” circled on it. Grandpa Monster then decieded to become a star pupil. A shooting star lands on a spider web in the corner of the frame. He’s “still working on shaking [his] bad reputation.” A 6.2 ton kettlebell weight is shown. Grandpa Monster says “when this old monster takes his mask off, I hope you’re not afraid of who I was a long time ago.” He closes the clues package yelling at men in black for hititng him with an inflatable beach ball.</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading id=block-aed0ca83-5ae3-4549-9411-272b33f78a6d>Popular Guesses for The Masked Singer Grandpa Monster</h4><p>The panelists thought Grandpa Monster might be Ashton Kutcher, Dax Shepard, Johnny Manziel, The Miz, or Scott Disick after his first performance and clues. The guesses online have been a little all over the place! Fans are predicting Grandpa Monster could be Baker Mayfield, Kel Mitchell, or Logan or Jake Paul.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=block-dbd3758a-2c07-4407-884a-af68d22f49c4>Who is Grandpa Monster on The Masked Singer?</h2><p id=block-368e3453-5d4b-4448-a575-0fe21bda999f>This has been the hardest Group B celebrity to predict. There are so many athletes who have worn the #6 or been known for being a troublemaker! The clues didn’t exactly narrow it down much. But listening to the voice and taking the clues into consideration, we think Grandpa Monster is…</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/close-icon.png><p id=block-eb4a6776-9b31-44f2-8abe-d267d1b20c62><strong>Logan Paul!</strong></p><p id=block-1b37ce66-508a-4e79-b1db-eb10a82e0a2f>We didn’t want to believe it, but the clues are all pointing this direction. And the voice too! Here’s how everything lines up. First, Cluedle-doo’s clue saying he “has trained for battle before” is talking about how Logan is now boxers. When Grandpa Monster talks about being a “troublemaking fool as a youngster,” that definitely fits too. Both Logan and his brother Jake have had their fair share of controversy. Logan also played football growing up, which explains the six written like a football play. And that “6” on the chalkboard could be referring to Vine, where Logan Paul became famous for his six-second videos.</p><p class=has-text-align-center id=block-b48d7fb3-c871-4726-9e94-88c63344529a><strong>FOR MORE CLUES DECODED: <a href=#>RACCOON</a> | <a href=#>RUSSIAN DOLLS</a> | <a href=#>ROBOPINE</a> | <a href=#>THE PIGLET</a> | <a href=#>BLACK SWAN</a> | <a href=#>CHAMELEON</a> | <a href=#>SEASHELL</a></strong></p><p id=block-a766f1a5-e470-49e0-9f5f-a94403f9a903>Logan has done acting before, so that explains the “acting out clip” and at one point we could hear what sounded like a sound effect from the Nickelodeon show Figure It Out. If that’s true, then that could be pointing to Jake Paul’s show Bizaardvark, which Logan guest starred on. The “97%” could be a nod to the year his brother Jake was born. When a shooting star hit a spider web, that’s an obvious reference to him being a web star. The “6.2” on the kettlebell could also be alluding to Logan’s height, or his career as a cruiserweight boxer now.</p><p id=block-b059d09d-9b41-40c0-a5c4-c7c0ffec307f>Do you agree with our prediction?

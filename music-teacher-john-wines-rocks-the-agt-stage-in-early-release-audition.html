He admitted that he was nervous about his audition, but it turns out he didn’t have anything to be nervous about, because he totally rocked the AGT stage.</p><p>The judges seemed unsure what to expect when John pulled out an electric guitar. But once he started playing “We Will Rock You” by Queen, they were amazed by his talent. Along with the audience, they began clapping in time with the song.</p><p>The entire panel gave John a standing ovation for his electrifying performance. When the crowd started chanting that they wanted to hear more from him, John became emotional.

Did you ever imagine that you could be a rock star?” said judge Sofia Vergara after John’s performance.</p><p>Simon Cowell said John seemed “so normal and nice and sweet,” but said he turns into someone else when he performs. Heidi Klum said he was “the cutest” for how surprised he was by their reaction. John admitted he was waiting for them to hit their red buzzers.</p><p>John ended up receiving four “yes” votes to move on.

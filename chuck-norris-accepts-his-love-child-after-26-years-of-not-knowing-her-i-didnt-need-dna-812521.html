He&nbsp;admitted to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>cheating</a> on&nbsp;his first wife, Holechek, in&nbsp;1962, and a&nbsp;daughter named Dina Morris was born from the affair. Norris was unaware of&nbsp;Dina’s existence until she reached out to&nbsp;him in&nbsp;1991, 26&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>years</a> after she was born, claiming to&nbsp;be&nbsp;his biological daughter.</p><p>Norris had a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>brief fling</a> with a&nbsp;woman named Johanna while stationed in&nbsp;California with the US&nbsp;Air Force. Their passionate encounter in&nbsp;the back of&nbsp;a&nbsp;car resulted in&nbsp;the birth of&nbsp;Dina Norris. Norris revealed that he&nbsp;still feels ashamed about lying to&nbsp;Dina’s mother, Johanna. “To&nbsp;my&nbsp;shame, I&nbsp;never told Johanna that&nbsp;I was married,” Norris <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>confessed</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/61c/be9/573567572e8465c84ac022a96c.jpg><p>Despite her mother’s advice, Dina Norris persisted and eventually reached out to&nbsp;Norris.

Norris said that at&nbsp;that moment, it&nbsp;felt as&nbsp;if&nbsp;he&nbsp;had known her all his life.

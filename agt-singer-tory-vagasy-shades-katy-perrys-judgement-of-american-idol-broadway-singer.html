However, a recent incident on the show has raised concerns about the treatment of singers from certain genres and backgrounds. One singer who spoke out against Katy Perry‚Äôs recent mockery of theatre music was Tory Vagasy, a former America‚Äôs Got Talent contestant.</strong></p><p>During a recent audition on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">American Idol</a>, a Broadway singer named Emma Busse performed for the judges. The singer showcased her impressive vocal range and stage presence singing ‚ÄúGoodbye Yellow Brick Road,‚Äù by Elton John.</p><p>The judges did not seem particularly impressed with her performance though. In fact, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Perry</a> made a comment that did not sit well with many viewers. Perry walked up to the singer after her performance and said, ‚Äúyou should shake it all off,‚Äù referring to ‚Äúget all that Broadway‚Äù out of her singing.</p><p>Perry‚Äôs actions of making fun of Broadway did not go unnoticed by singers of the genre and by most viewers. In a short video on her <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TikTok account</a>, Vagasy criticized Perry‚Äôs comments and defended the importance of Broadway as a musical genre.</p><p>Vagasy‚Äôs comments echo the sentiments of many Broadway fans and performers who have felt marginalized or overlooked by the mainstream music industry. While Broadway may not be as commercially successful as other genres like pop or hip-hop, it is a respected and influential industry that has produced many talented singers and performers.</p><a title=@once.upon.a.tory href=# rel=noopener>@once.upon.a.tory</a> We will NOT be ‚Äúsmacking out the broadway,‚Äù thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è <a title=brodway href=# rel=noopener>#brodway</a> <a title=musicaltheatre href=# rel=noopener>#musicaltheatre</a> <a title=americanidol href=# rel=noopener>#americanidol</a> <a title=agt href=# rel=noopener>#agt</a> <a title=americasgottalent href=# rel=noopener>#americasgottalent</a> <a title="‚ô¨ original sound - Victoria ‚ÄúTory‚Äù Vagasy üëë" href=# rel=noopener>‚ô¨ original sound ‚Äì Victoria ‚ÄúTory‚Äù Vagasy üëë</a><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Howie Mandel Based Broadway Music on America‚Äôs Got Talent</h2><p>Vagasy revealed that she had fallen in love with musical theatre at a young age and had been performing it ever since. Vagasy‚Äôs love of musical theatre was evident in her AGT audition, where she sang ‚ÄúInto The Unknown‚Äù from the movie Frozen 2.</p><p>However, judge <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Howie Mandel</a> voted no, sparking an outcry from fellow judges and fans of the show. Even host Terry Crews was seen shaking his head in disbelief at Mandel‚Äôs decision. Before saying no, he explained that the song was great, but Broadway music wasn‚Äôt his favorite.</p><p>‚ÄúI just wanna know why reality TV has decided to bash on Broadway like it isn‚Äôt one of the biggest most influential industries in the world,‚Äù Vagasy said. ‚ÄúYou know how many pop stars are on Broadway? I don‚Äôt understand.‚Äù</p><p>Since her AGT appearance, Vagasy has continued to pursue her music career and advocate for the importance of Broadway and other musical genres. Her recent critiquing of Perry‚Äôs comments on American Idol has earned her even more respect and admiration from fans of musical theatre and Broadway.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Original_Marcia_Anetra-220x147.jpg alt="Anetra, Marcia Marcia Marcia Deliver Iconic Lip Sync on ‚ÄòRuPaul‚Äôs Drag Race‚Äô" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57wKCrZquZo7SmvoytpquxXauuqK3SsmSsoJGZsrR5ypqrsmWgmr%2BzxdJmoa6cl5q6prrTZqafZZGisrO1wpqlZqGUpLlurtGomJ2vka56tLXNoJyrZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. ¬© 2022.

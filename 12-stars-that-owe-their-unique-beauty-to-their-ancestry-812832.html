1. Keanu Reeves: English, Irish, Portuguese, Native Hawaiian, Chinese, and Dutch
Keanu is probably one of the most famous Canadian citizens in the world. He has a broad ethnic heritage, but ironically, he has no link to Canada in his ancestry, not even by birth, since Keanu was born in Lebanon."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

He&nbsp;has a&nbsp;broad <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>ethnic heritage</a>, but ironically, he&nbsp;has no&nbsp;link to&nbsp;Canada in&nbsp;his ancestry, not even by&nbsp;birth, since Keanu was born in&nbsp;Lebanon. His father, a&nbsp;Hawaiian geologist (with Portuguese, <a href=# title=English data-link=tag>English</a>, Scottish, Chinese, and Dutch ancestry), and his mother, an&nbsp;English dancer and costume designer, met in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Beirut</a>. Soon after that, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Keanu</a> was born.</p><p>His name means “fresh breeze” in&nbsp;Hawaiian. After his parents’ divorce, the actor and his mother lived part of&nbsp;his childhood in&nbsp;Australia and the United States, to&nbsp;later settle permanently in&nbsp;Canada, hence his Canadian citizenship.</p><p><h2>2. Shakira: Lebanese, Spanish, Italian and Indigenous</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7c9/c34/059e575759a4d016bf0c0d4c64.jpg><p>Sharika’s <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>DNA</a> combines a&nbsp;set of&nbsp;diverse cultures, such as&nbsp;Arab, Latin, and European. Her paternal grandparents were Lebanese immigrants who settled in&nbsp;New York, where her father was born. Later the family moved to&nbsp;Colombia, where her parents met.</p><p>On&nbsp;her <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>mother’s side</a>, she has indigenous, Spanish, and Italian ancestry. Through her music, she has tried to&nbsp;show the world part of&nbsp;her cultural richness, including in&nbsp;her song’s native rhythms and her performances of&nbsp;traditional dances, such as&nbsp;the Arab dance or&nbsp;the Colombian Afro-Latin styles. Her love for Colombia has led her to&nbsp;become a&nbsp;<a href=#>philanthropist</a> too.</p><p><h2>3. Avan Jogia: English, Irish and Indian</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c66/70f/652ef750f996d568e04c8e0244.jpg><p>Handsome actor <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Avan Jogia</a> also harbors an&nbsp;interesting <a href=#>ethnic mix</a> in&nbsp;his genes. His father was born in&nbsp;London, UK, but is&nbsp;of&nbsp;Indian descent, while his mother is&nbsp;of&nbsp;English, German, and Welsh ancestry. In&nbsp;addition to&nbsp;English, the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>actor</a> also speaks French and some Gujarati Hindi while legally holding two nationalities, Canadian and English.</p><p>Being of&nbsp;mixed race has been an&nbsp;experience of&nbsp;mixed feelings when it&nbsp;comes to&nbsp;discovering his own identity, so&nbsp;much so&nbsp;that he&nbsp;wrote a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>book</a> about&nbsp;it, which he&nbsp;hopes can help others who, like him, feel confused about their identity. “The goal of&nbsp;this book is&nbsp;to&nbsp;be&nbsp;like a&nbsp;framework or&nbsp;a&nbsp;guide, or&nbsp;at&nbsp;least to&nbsp;ask the right questions that might inspire you to&nbsp;define or&nbsp;discover who you really are.”</p><p><h2>4.

She has Filipino, Spanish, and Chinese ancestors in&nbsp;her maternal line.</p><p><h2>5. Taylor Lautner: Dutch, French and German, and Native American</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/189/863/accb9354ad950d383e973303c1.jpg><p>Although most of&nbsp;his ancestry is&nbsp;European, Lautner also has a&nbsp;small <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>distant</a> part of&nbsp;Native American relatives from the Odawa and Potawatomi tribes. He&nbsp;is&nbsp;of&nbsp;Dutch, French and German descent. He&nbsp;has <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>stated</a> that while preparing his role in&nbsp;the <i>Twilight</i> saga, he&nbsp;and his family could discover that through his mother’s line, they were distantly descended from a&nbsp;Native American tribe, the Anishinaabe.</p><p><h2>6. Demi Lovato: Mexican, Spanish, Native American, English, Scottish, Irish, and Portuguese</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/178/4d9/92dd205dc5a3f7df76c2961651.jpg><p>On&nbsp;her mother’s side, <a href=# title=Demi data-link=tag>Demi</a> has English and Northern Irish <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>ancestry</a>. On&nbsp;the other hand, her father comes from a&nbsp;Mexican family that lived in&nbsp;New Mexico for several generations. Like many people of&nbsp;Mexican descent, her father had both Spanish and indigenous roots and a&nbsp;small amount of&nbsp;Portuguese and Sephardic Jewish ancestry.</p><p>Her curiosity about her family’s past encouraged her to&nbsp;take a&nbsp;DNA test. The <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>results</a> showed that an&nbsp;interesting ethnic cocktail runs through her veins. While her genetic ancestry is&nbsp;mainly European (85&nbsp;%), with 32&nbsp;% from the Iberian Peninsula, 16&nbsp;% from Scandinavia, 14&nbsp;% from Ireland, 11&nbsp;% from Great Britain, and 7&nbsp;% from Western Europe, she also has 10&nbsp;% Native American, 4&nbsp;% Asian, 1&nbsp;% African and 5&nbsp;% from unspecified areas.</p><p><h2>7. Vin Diesel: African, Scots, English and German</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/656/045/b46fa95a3aadcc4f48619dcae4.jpg><p>This 55-year-old actor never got to&nbsp;know his biological father; he&nbsp;only knows what his mother could <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>tell</a> him. She knew he&nbsp;was African-American, and they lived in&nbsp;a&nbsp;challenging time, so&nbsp;they couldn’t disclose their relationship.</p><p>“When I&nbsp;was in&nbsp;my&nbsp;mother’s womb, it&nbsp;was still illegal in&nbsp;some parts of&nbsp;the United States for people of&nbsp;color and whites to&nbsp;procreate,” <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Diesel</a> said. “Everyone knew me&nbsp;as&nbsp;a&nbsp;janitor because&nbsp;I couldn’t get any other job. There was something too ambiguous about the way I&nbsp;looked.” He&nbsp;said that the start of&nbsp;his career was not easy; when he&nbsp;auditioned, many considered him “too white” for some roles while appearing as&nbsp;“too Afro” for others.</p><p><h2>8. Zendaya: African-American, German, Irish, Irish, English, and Scottish</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e73/2c1/62e990544ca4abb7f438ca3b65.jpg><p>Zendaya also has mixed features due to&nbsp;her diverse ethnic background, such as&nbsp;African and European. Her <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>father</a> is&nbsp;African-American and comes from a&nbsp;family originally from Arkansas. On&nbsp;her mother’s side, on&nbsp;the other hand, her ancestry is&nbsp;European, more precisely German, Irish, English, and Scottish. The name “Zendaya” is&nbsp;of&nbsp;African origin and means “to&nbsp;give thanks” in&nbsp;Shona, a&nbsp;southwestern African language spoken in&nbsp;Zimbabwe.</p><p><h2>9.

On&nbsp;his father’s side, he&nbsp;has English, German, and Irish ancestry, while on&nbsp;his mother’s side, he&nbsp;is&nbsp;of&nbsp;Chinese, Filipino, and Spanish descent. While he&nbsp;is&nbsp;half-Asian, no&nbsp;one has taken a&nbsp;particular interest in&nbsp;that due to&nbsp;his European <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>appearance</a>. “I’ve always been proud of&nbsp;my&nbsp;Filipino background. The fact that people don’t notice it&nbsp;doesn’t make it&nbsp;any less real to&nbsp;me.”</p><p>Like many other celebrities, he&nbsp;also <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>confessed</a> that a&nbsp;diverse background could sometimes be&nbsp;a&nbsp;confusing experience to&nbsp;deal with when it&nbsp;comes to&nbsp;forging one’s identity. “You’re faced with two experiences that show different reactions. Not just on&nbsp;the inside but on&nbsp;the outside. Who are you to&nbsp;the world? How do&nbsp;they see you? How do&nbsp;you see yourself? What if&nbsp;you look more like one thing than the other, which one are you?”</p><p><h2>10. Jesse Williams: African American, Native American and Swedish</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f6b/40c/717b5b5ebfa06fc8b1d17cf05f.jpg><p>Jesse charmed <i>Grey’s Anatomy</i>’s <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>fans</a> with his unique and exotic traits. His ethnic mixtures, African-American on&nbsp;his father’s side and Swedish-American on&nbsp;his mother’s side gave him a&nbsp;distinctive combination of&nbsp;traits you’re unlikely to&nbsp;find easily.</p><p>Besides being an&nbsp;actor, he&nbsp;also works as&nbsp;a&nbsp;model, and thanks to&nbsp;his charming features, he&nbsp;has topped many male beauty lists: he&nbsp;was included in&nbsp;<i>People</i>’s <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>selection</a> of&nbsp;the most attractive men in&nbsp;the world.</p><p><h2>11.

She was born in&nbsp;London, England, and on&nbsp;her father’s side, all her ancestry is&nbsp;English; on&nbsp;her mother’s side, she is&nbsp;Gujarati Indian.</p><p>Naomi says that she also felt that her mixed race made it&nbsp;difficult for her to&nbsp;become an&nbsp;actress, and many scripts she really wanted were sent to&nbsp;other people. Her multi-ethnic persona confused <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Hollywood</a>. “When you’re like&nbsp;me, people think, ’She’s not white, she’s not black, she’s not Latina, what is&nbsp;she?’ Ultimately, maybe she was the ’other option,’ or&nbsp;the ’exotic’ option.”</p><p><h2>12.

Still, Samoan culture has been an&nbsp;important part of&nbsp;his and his siblings’ upbringing throughout his life. One of&nbsp;his favorite traditions of&nbsp;Samoan culture is&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>tattoos</a>. Practically, his entire family has some, and he&nbsp;is&nbsp;no&nbsp;exception.</p><p>“My&nbsp;grandfather was a&nbsp;Grand Chief of&nbsp;our people.

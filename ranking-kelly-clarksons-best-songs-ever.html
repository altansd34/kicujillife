Over the years, the singer has released a vast discography, from top-notch pop songs to heartbreaking ballads. Indeed, Clarkson is every inch an iconic pop megastar.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-ranking-kelly-clarkson-s-best-songs-ever>Ranking Kelly Clarkson’s Best Songs Ever</h2><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-10-mine>10. “Mine”</h3><p>One of Kelly Clarkson’s most recent hits had to be included. Her newest album, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Chemistry</a>, intense, filled with emotions following her divorce. The songs beautiful lyrics pull you in, and Clarkson’s emotion holds you throughout the entirety of the track.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-9-behind-these-hazel-eyes>9. “Behind These Hazel Eyes”</h3><p>If you’re going through a breakup, “Behind These Hazel Eyes” is the track for you. The message of this song is that your heart can get torn into pieces, but your pride won’t let your heartbreaker the satisfaction of seeing you cry. This 2005 smash hit may be a breakup song, but it’s one that tells you to be stand tall despite grief.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-8-underneath-the-tree>8. “Underneath The Tree”</h3><p>Clarkson is not only an expert in creating songs about romance; she also knows how to get into the spirit of Christmas. It’s valid to argue that a holiday playlist wouldn’t be complete without the pop megastar’s 2013 track “Underneath The Tree.” Like many other timeless Christmas songs, this piece is coded to be played on repeat as soon as the happy holidays begin.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-7-a-moment-like-this>7. “A Moment Like This”</h3><p>There’s no way any American Idol fan could forget Clarkson’s winning song, “A Moment Like This.” This single truly started it all for her. Clarkson was 20 years old when she sang this song, but she belted every line like she was an old woman adept of life’s challenges.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-6-because-of-you>6. “Because of You”</h3><p>Most people say a masterpiece cannot be created without digging deep into the past and opening previous wounds; this rings true for Clarkson. “Because of You” is a track that exposes the singer’s pains caused by her parents’ divorce. Within the lyrics, the A-lister revealed her fear of falling in love, perfectly resonating with the impassioned impact of the song’s piano tunes, heavy drums, and violins.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-5-breakaway>5. “Breakaway”</h3><p>It’s an understatement to describe “Breakaway” as an inspirational record. Clarkson named her sophomore album after this track, and it’s not puzzling why. With its powerful melody and sentimental rhythms, it has smoothly cemented itself as one Clarkson’s classic hits.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-4-my-life-would-suck-without-you>4. “My Life Would Suck Without You”</h3><p>Ever experienced a dysfunctional relationship and can’t find it within yourself to let them go? If yes, then you’ve finally found your anthem. Clarkson wrote “My Life Would Suck Without You” without a specific person in mind, noting that she might experience that kind of love someday.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-3-piece-by-piece>3. “Piece By Piece”</h3><p>Clarkson’s mega hit “Piece By Piece” can be considered as the follow-up track to “Because of You.” In the song, Clarkson expressed her suffering after her father left her at a young age. It may be a song about her heartbreak, but its emotional brunt is beautifully touching. From “Because Of You,” Clarkson has proven that her artistry can be more vulnerable than the last time that it was.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-2-stronger-what-doesn-t-kill-you>2. “Stronger (What Doesn’t Kill You)”</h3><p>Let’s admit it — “Stronger (What Doesn’t Kill You)” will always be one of our favorite energetic songs from <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Clarkson</a>. This track is undeniably a dose of confidence boost, one that makes your heart thump like crazy. It may be a heartbreak song, but it goes beyond coping from a painful relationship. It’s an upbeat reminder that you’re stronger than your devastation from love.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-1-since-u-been-gone>1. “Since U Been Gone”</h3><p>Clarkson introduced the superstar the she is from the very beginning of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">American Idol</a>, but her power as a rock star started when she released “Since U Been Gone.” This bubblegum and indie rock-influenced song is an irresistible track, her first shot of being the diva of heartbreak songs. Suffice to say, no kid in the 2000s doesn’t know this iconic song.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Original_Zendaya_TomHolland_Cindy-OrdGetty-Images-for-SiriusXM-220x147.jpeg alt="Tom Holland, Zendaya Relationship Timeline From ‘Spider-Man: Homecoming’ To Now" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK570ZqlpKGenHqssculsGabnJa%2FrL%2FOp6pmmpWowW6%2FzqeerGWVq7Kzew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

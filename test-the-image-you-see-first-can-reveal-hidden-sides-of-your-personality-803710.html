What do you see first in this image?1. If you saw a little girl
You may have fears that are repressed from your childhood."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

If&nbsp;you saw a&nbsp;little girl</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/2d2/895/e141af5db0831b8619c732dd03.jpg><p>You may have fears that are repressed from your childhood. A&nbsp;child’s mind has many different events that can affect&nbsp;it. However, if&nbsp;they are not explained properly, they can come out in&nbsp;adulthood in&nbsp;different ways, like addiction, fear, inappropriate desires, and cognitive patterns.</p><p>For your emotional development, your relationship with your mom is&nbsp;important. If&nbsp;you had to&nbsp;spend too much time away from your mom or&nbsp;you didn’t have a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;affection while growing&nbsp;up, it’s possible that you have unconscious fears. This can affect the ability to&nbsp;make decisions and take responsibility.</p><p>This can also happen while being an&nbsp;infant, in&nbsp;the perinatal phase, or&nbsp;even during delivery or&nbsp;gestation.</p><p><h2>2. If&nbsp;you saw a&nbsp;butterfly</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/969/0b5/d5faae531e927de23465964b2b.jpg><p>The <a href=# title=butterfly data-link=tag>butterfly</a> usually symbolizes positivity. However, it&nbsp;holds an&nbsp;unconscious meaning that comes from a&nbsp;bit of&nbsp;a&nbsp;darker place. Your unconscious fear might be&nbsp;about missing out on&nbsp;chances. Also, you might have suppressed emotions of&nbsp;grief about people that are not with you anymore.</p><p><h2>3. If&nbsp;you saw a&nbsp;raspberry</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b36/be7/10ae955c7781e2574a1c9aac28.jpg><p>In&nbsp;this case, the raspberry in&nbsp;the image is&nbsp;placed in&nbsp;the center, and it’s larger than the actual size of&nbsp;the berry, and this is&nbsp;because it&nbsp;represents the heart. It’s a&nbsp;symbol of&nbsp;<a href=# title=love data-link=tag>love</a>.</p><p>However, if&nbsp;you saw the raspberry first, this means that the answer to&nbsp;what you are looking for is&nbsp;actually in&nbsp;your heart. Your unconscious fear comes from resisting love without being aware of&nbsp;it.</p><p><h2>4. If&nbsp;you saw a&nbsp;spider</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7ae/d6f/fd1e355ca3bb0b0d3ff17ed129.jpg><p>One of&nbsp;the most common fears among people is&nbsp;the fear of&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>spiders</a>. It’s actually a&nbsp;survival mechanism that helped&nbsp;us stay alert of&nbsp;little dangers that used to&nbsp;surround&nbsp;us. However, when it&nbsp;comes to&nbsp;symbols, the spider shows that you might be&nbsp;afraid of&nbsp;your surroundings not being safe.</p><p>Seeing this figure first means that you don’t feel safe in&nbsp;an&nbsp;<a href=# title=environment data-link=tag>environment</a>. You always check the details and almost always find something dangerous. This prevents you from seeing the beauty that surrounds you and the happy moments. You most likely overthink your every move too.</p><p><h2>5. If&nbsp;you saw trees</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/615/6ba/568f48534289243ef7c0bc906f.jpg><p>The tree is&nbsp;an&nbsp;important psychological symbol. In&nbsp;fact, it’s used in&nbsp;psychoanalytical <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>tests</a> that can evaluate the psyche depending on&nbsp;where on&nbsp;a&nbsp;piece of&nbsp;paper the person draws the tree. However, right now, since the tree symbolizes our roots, it&nbsp;has a&nbsp;deeper meaning.</p><p>The trees that form a&nbsp;bridge mean you might be&nbsp;having an&nbsp;inner conflict that you still have not solved. So&nbsp;this could indicate that you have a&nbsp;fear of&nbsp;accepting an&nbsp;unconscious emotional split. You are developing your identity around the shadow of&nbsp;resisting to&nbsp;merge with yourself.</p><p><h2>6. If&nbsp;you saw teddy bears</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/25e/27e/d7109c5cf89aad75d2948a3605.jpg><p>Most of&nbsp;us, when we&nbsp;were kids, found comfort by&nbsp;hugging our teddy bear. It’s like a&nbsp;place where there was warmth, safety, and understanding. Well, that’s why a&nbsp;teddy bear stands for a&nbsp;friend who can understand you unconditionally.</p><p>However, in&nbsp;the image, the teddy bears are a&nbsp;bit twisted, and if&nbsp;you saw them first, this says something very curious about yourself. You are actually afraid of&nbsp;being afraid. This is&nbsp;most likely due to&nbsp;unconscious trauma that probably happened during childhood at&nbsp;a&nbsp;time when you were afraid but didn’t have anything to&nbsp;comfort yourself with.</p><p><h2>7. If&nbsp;you saw a&nbsp;skull</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e3b/6b0/f008f35a2d92d9c053bf43e26c.jpg><p>Seeing the skull first might mean that you have a&nbsp;hard time making decisions, especially if&nbsp;you are faced with important issues. This could be&nbsp;due to&nbsp;low self-esteem&nbsp;— you don’t trust yourself enough to&nbsp;take the next step and do&nbsp;the right thing.</p><p>Your problem with self-esteem might be&nbsp;because you were never appreciated by&nbsp;your parents or&nbsp;close friends for your accomplishments, and you felt like you were never good enough.</p><p>Which one did you see first? Did the test guess your personality accurately?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZMGmv9Nmq6GdXZ66orPEZrCorV2osqZ5xaKprKxdmK6vedGerZ6ZnGK1qrDDnqVmq5mZsrR5zp9ksqelp3qxsdGspqeZnJ7BunmXaWpwaWBk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

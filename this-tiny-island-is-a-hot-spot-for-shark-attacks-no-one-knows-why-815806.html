For many years, people living there haven’t been able to&nbsp;find a&nbsp;way to&nbsp;stop this. Neither can they understand why sharks come there so&nbsp;often. So... What’s going&nbsp;on?</p><p>Why do&nbsp;these predators keep bothering this specific island while completely ignoring the others in&nbsp;the area? Let’s go&nbsp;to&nbsp;this mysterious place and try to&nbsp;find out! July&nbsp;22, 2015. The ocean waters near Reunion Island were clear and transparent. The western part of&nbsp;the island, Saint-Leu, had always been a&nbsp;great spot for surfing.</p><p>But on&nbsp;this pleasant, sunny day, one of&nbsp;the locals almost lost his life. A&nbsp;six-foot bull shark appeared out of&nbsp;nowhere. Once right next to&nbsp;the shore, it&nbsp;suddenly charged at&nbsp;surfer Rodolphe Arriéguy. His friend, doctor and professor of&nbsp;geography at&nbsp;the University of&nbsp;La&nbsp;Reunion Erwann Lagabrielle, was nearby, talking with two other surfers at&nbsp;that moment.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/6fa/0d0/bd6c52526fbb0cfbe054970974.png><p>Suddenly, they heard some noise. Realizing that it&nbsp;was his friend, Lagabrielle rushed to&nbsp;help. The shark was 65&nbsp;feet away from him. He&nbsp;said that all of&nbsp;this felt like some kind of&nbsp;a&nbsp;horror movie. He&nbsp;rushed to&nbsp;Arriéguy, even though he&nbsp;didn’t understand what exactly had happened. At&nbsp;first, Arriéguy’s body was surrounded by&nbsp;white foam. It&nbsp;then began to&nbsp;turn pink, and then... red. Lagabrielle said later that it&nbsp;had been one of&nbsp;the scariest things he&nbsp;had seen in&nbsp;his life. Fortunately, when he&nbsp;swam closer, the shark had already been gone.</p><p>Lagabrielle knew that in&nbsp;most cases, a&nbsp;second attack doesn’t happen. So&nbsp;he&nbsp;hurried to&nbsp;help his friend. It&nbsp;took them some time to&nbsp;get back to&nbsp;the shore. When Lagabrielle pulled his friend onto the beach, he&nbsp;immediately made a&nbsp;tourniquet from a&nbsp;surfboard leash. After that, Monsieur Arriéguy was rushed to&nbsp;the hospital. Fortunately, this story has a&nbsp;good ending. Although the 45-year-old man lost his arm, he&nbsp;still survived. But he&nbsp;was one of&nbsp;the few lucky ones. Because this horrifying story is&nbsp;just one of&nbsp;dozens that happened on&nbsp;Reunion Island in&nbsp;recent decades.</p><p>Reunion Island is&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the regions of&nbsp;France. It’s located right near Madagascar together with its neighbor Mauritius. They’re both located at&nbsp;the same latitude as&nbsp;Australia. These two islands are very similar. They have almost the same climate and natural conditions, similar languages and cultures. But there’s one huge difference between the two of&nbsp;them. In&nbsp;Mauritius, people can relax and have fun in&nbsp;the warm waters of&nbsp;the Indian Ocean, swimming with scuba gear and watching dolphins. Meanwhile, on&nbsp;La&nbsp;Reunion, locals are afraid to&nbsp;even put their fingers in&nbsp;the water. But why is&nbsp;that? Unfortunately, Reunion now has a&nbsp;strong reputation as&nbsp;a&nbsp;“shark island.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/c74/41f/a1356e520b8b6b74d2cb468aa4.png><p>By&nbsp;2018, 56&nbsp;attacks had occurred there. From 2011 to&nbsp;2016, the number of&nbsp;these cases accounted for&nbsp;16% of&nbsp;the worldwide shark attacks. Now, there are warning signs everywhere on&nbsp;Reunion. Local citizens and fishers have begun to&nbsp;discuss the options of&nbsp;large-scale shark trapping. The authorities forbid people to&nbsp;swim almost everywhere, except for a&nbsp;few more or&nbsp;less safe places&nbsp;— like, for example, a&nbsp;coral lagoon.</p><p>And still, any fisher or&nbsp;scientist knows that sharks can easily get inside these “coral rings.” In&nbsp;other words, locals and tourists can’t feel completely safe anywhere on&nbsp;the island. Meanwhile, in&nbsp;Mauritius, the last shark attack happened in&nbsp;the 1980s. People come here to&nbsp;relax, and everything is&nbsp;perfectly fine. So&nbsp;the question&nbsp;is, “Why in&nbsp;the world is&nbsp;La&nbsp;Reunion so&nbsp;unlucky?”</p><p>Dr. Lagabrielle, the hero&nbsp;I mentioned before, set himself the goal of&nbsp;explaining this strange phenomenon. His study showed that over the past 30&nbsp;years, the probability of&nbsp;a&nbsp;shark attack on&nbsp;Reunion had increased by&nbsp;23&nbsp;times! And in&nbsp;9&nbsp;out of&nbsp;10&nbsp;cases, it&nbsp;turns out to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;bull shark. If&nbsp;you haven’t heard about&nbsp;it, this creature looks exactly like what you imagine when you hear the word “shark.”</p><p>It’s one of&nbsp;the most popular species and the one that you often see in&nbsp;different movies and cartoons. These sharks live in&nbsp;tropical and subtropical waters in&nbsp;all oceans. Most often, they’re found&nbsp;— yeah, you’ve probably already guessed&nbsp;— in&nbsp;the southern waters between Australia and South Africa. This place is&nbsp;even nicknamed a&nbsp;“shark highway” because these predators really, really like to&nbsp;chill around there.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/8b6/dbd/0273d15e7d989f25588b470a6e.png><p>This is&nbsp;also one of&nbsp;the most aggressive shark species, and it’s very dangerous for humans. Unfortunately, it’s also very tolerant to&nbsp;different water salinity. Which means they can basically swim even in&nbsp;freshwater and be&nbsp;totally cool with&nbsp;it. But why do&nbsp;all these Reunion Island attacks happen so&nbsp;often?</p><p>Well, there are many theories and many different factors that might play their role in&nbsp;all this. Marc Soria, a&nbsp;researcher at&nbsp;the IRD (the French National Institute for Research and Development), decided to&nbsp;conduct a&nbsp;study together with his team. They spent 3&nbsp;years trying to&nbsp;collect data on&nbsp;45&nbsp;tiger sharks and 38&nbsp;bull sharks living in&nbsp;local waters.</p><p>The National Research Institute of&nbsp;France supported this study. It&nbsp;was also funded by&nbsp;three research foundations: regional, national, and European. That’s when you know that the problem is&nbsp;serious. And now, here are the main theories developed by&nbsp;Soria’s team and Lagabrielle.</p><p>The first one is&nbsp;excessive fishing. Experts suggest that long-term fishing and catching small reef sharks, which competed with dangerous sharks for food and territory, eventually led to&nbsp;these dramatic consequences. Unfortunately, when predatory bull sharks ran out of&nbsp;food, they just had to&nbsp;go&nbsp;looking for it&nbsp;near the coast.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/8a0/871/70675557f9acaa4190e80bd513.png><p>For bull sharks, surfers on&nbsp;Reunion look like sick, weakened fish&nbsp;— and, therefore, an&nbsp;easy meal. Also, while in&nbsp;Mauritius, surfers tend to&nbsp;hang out near sandy beaches, on&nbsp;Reunion, they choose places where waves break at&nbsp;coral reefs. But this is&nbsp;exactly where the sharks choose to&nbsp;search for food, so... Yeah. The second possible reason is&nbsp;muddy waters.</p><p>Bull sharks like such conditions very much. And although there are no&nbsp;natural places like these on&nbsp;Reunion, the reason could be&nbsp;the construction of&nbsp;urban areas. Muddy freshwater gets into bays from cities. This water attracts sharks, and this is&nbsp;where the attacks take place most often. But then we&nbsp;can ask again, “Why not Mauritius?”</p><p>Urbanization is&nbsp;also in&nbsp;full swing there, after all. There are many places in&nbsp;Mauritius where sewage waters flow into the ocean. Well, then we&nbsp;can conclude that this is&nbsp;not the only factor; there have to&nbsp;be&nbsp;others. For example, there is&nbsp;an&nbsp;active volcano Piton de&nbsp;la&nbsp;Fournaise on&nbsp;Reunion Island. Thanks to&nbsp;this beautiful volcano, there are rich flora and fauna on&nbsp;the island. And this could be&nbsp;great if&nbsp;it&nbsp;didn’t attract too much attention from predators.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/76d/33e/5612b253e8b11b06658ac9d9dc.png><p>Because of&nbsp;the volcano, the shores of&nbsp;Reunion are less steep, which makes it&nbsp;easier to&nbsp;swim closer to&nbsp;the coast. And sedimentary rocks that get washed away from the slopes of&nbsp;the volcano can attract bull sharks. As&nbsp;we&nbsp;already know, these guys love muddy waters.</p><p>There are some other theories. For example, Lagabrielle suggests that attacks may be&nbsp;connected to&nbsp;an&nbsp;increase in&nbsp;the shark population. Or&nbsp;maybe that’s because these creatures become more aggressive during mating periods. Some people assume that all of&nbsp;this could be&nbsp;Mauritius’ fault because they banned catching and selling sharks for meat.</p><p>But Soria and other experts strongly disagree with this. Not many people on&nbsp;both islands bought this meat to&nbsp;make any significant difference. Anyway, this whole situation caused a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;tension on&nbsp;Reunion.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/607/f5a/0943365c3bab9ce7a45e84d9c8.png><p>A&nbsp;big part of&nbsp;the population now supports the idea of&nbsp;catching sharks on&nbsp;a&nbsp;large scale. They also built some underwater fences near the island, and the maintenance of&nbsp;these fences costs a&nbsp;million dollars a&nbsp;year. It&nbsp;may seem pretty extreme, but drastic times require drastic measures. But despite all these terrible stories, in&nbsp;general, sharks aren’t nearly as&nbsp;dangerous as&nbsp;we&nbsp;think.</p><p>They almost never attack divers&nbsp;— unless a&nbsp;person provokes them. Experienced divers often compare sharks with stray dogs: these animals shouldn’t be&nbsp;feared but should be&nbsp;respected. Anyway, let’s hope that La&nbsp;Reunion will be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;solve this problem, and people will be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;swim in&nbsp;its warm, beautiful waters again.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZMGptdJmq6KmqWK2tLjAp5tmoaNirm60zq1krKifqXqnu9FmqqGZoqB6osDTmpqkq12jvG67zZ5kpKafrMBuw8eyZHFpZW19d3s%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

The popular singer and talk show host recently shared a funny story about a wardrobe malfunction that happened during the filming of her “Since U Been Gone” music video.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-kelly-clarkson-was-commando-while-filming-since-u-been-gone-music-video>Kelly Clarkson Was “Commando” While Filming “Since U Been Gone” Music Video</h2><p>During an episode of The Kelly Clarkson Show, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Clarkson</a> had a candid conversation with guest Kyle Richards about their Halloween outfits. Kyle, dressed in a snug leather catsuit, humorously described it as feeling like “one big Spanx from ankle to neck” and shared her fear of any wardrobe mishaps. That’s when Clarkson chimed in with her own wardrobe malfunction story.</p><p>She explained that during the filming of the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">music video</a>, the director asked her to squat down. The problem was that she was wearing extremely tight leather pants at the time.</p><p>“He was like, ‘Go down and pop back up!’ I was like, ‘Oh, okay, cool.’ And I went down and just, ‘Whoops!'” Clarkson said. “</p><p>What made the situation even more awkward was the fact that Clarkson was going “commando” underneath her pants. In the moment, she turned to the drummer behind her and humorously commented, “Oh sh*t, that’s a lot of moon, man. I’m sorry.”</p><p>This isn’t the first time Clarkson has openly discussed wardrobe malfunctions, especially ones involving a lack of underwear. In a previous episode of her talk show, she shared a different mishap where her dress almost came off during a performance because the zipper wasn’t secure. She laughed about the situation and said, “That would have gone real European beach real quick.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-kelly-clarkson-can-handle-unexpected-situations-really-well>Kelly Clarkson Can Handle Unexpected Situations Really Well</h2><p>Clarkson has a history of handling such situations with humor and grace.

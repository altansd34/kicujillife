There are many examples in&nbsp;the history of&nbsp;cinematography when <a href=# title=movie data-link=tag>movie</a> characters became the icons of&nbsp;style and started new <a href=# title=fashion data-link=tag>fashion</a> trends. All because clothes are an&nbsp;important attribute that helps fully unfold the characters’ personalities in&nbsp;a&nbsp;movie and adds a&nbsp;special charm to&nbsp;the movie’s atmosphere as&nbsp;well. In&nbsp;addition, many clothes that were considered stylish at&nbsp;a&nbsp;certain point in&nbsp;time haven’t lost their relevance, even today. After all, we&nbsp;all know that new things are actually just old things that were forgotten a&nbsp;long time ago.</p><p>We&nbsp;at&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side</strong> dove into nostalgia while we&nbsp;were choosing these iconic outfits from movies that have influenced the canons of&nbsp;beauty and style.</p><p><h2>The snow-white dress with a&nbsp;turtleneck from Basic Instinct</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/03b/e48/fcf1f35e31b198f79e37c7ac50.jpg><p>A&nbsp;laconic white dress can be&nbsp;more enticing than a&nbsp;mind-blowing evening gown with a&nbsp;deep neckline and designer <a href=#>Nino Cerruti</a> together with <a href=# title="Sharon Stone" data-link=tag>Sharon Stone</a> proved this. Thanks to&nbsp;this look, the vampy style changed while the gorgeous Sharon Stone showed that you can look stunning without black and red flowers, makeup, and other bright details.</p><p><h2>The black dress from Indecent Proposal</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/491/1e8/70d2a45aa4b10497ef68ac7839.jpeg><p>Fashion designer Thierry Mugler <a href=#>created</a> a&nbsp;charming floor-length black dress with an&nbsp;unusual neckline. It&nbsp;looked dashing on&nbsp;the actress. After the release of&nbsp;the movie in&nbsp;1993, fashion mongers started to&nbsp;copy Demi Moore’s look. However, they preferred to&nbsp;make the bottom part of&nbsp;the dress shorter, which made the dress look even more mind-blowing.</p><p><h2>Rachel Green’s outfits from the Friends TV&nbsp;series</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/3da/b67/d6e87d5c0ab696debdfa0f60a8.jpg><p>The <a href=# title=Friends data-link=tag>Friends</a> series was so&nbsp;popular in&nbsp;the ’90s that many girls were trying to&nbsp;copy Rachel’s looks. For example, try to&nbsp;remember her long-sleeved blouse worn under a&nbsp;light dress with spaghetti straps. It&nbsp;looks fresh, elegant, and practical because it’s the perfect opportunity to&nbsp;wear a&nbsp;favorite summer dress, even when it’s chilly outside.</p><p>Also, the plaid print is&nbsp;still chic too: Rachel’s outfit with a&nbsp;sleeveless turtleneck and a&nbsp;checkered pencil skirt would look stylish even today. By&nbsp;the way, ordinary black trousers for office-wear can be&nbsp;combined with almost anything and Rachel proved this. In&nbsp;addition to&nbsp;those trousers, she wore a&nbsp;light blouse with delicate embroidery and transparent sleeves.</p><p><h2>The bold and posh dress from the movie Casino</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/c1d/bea/e3f99a5d93ae606cb31a516823.jpeg><p>In&nbsp;the ’90s, clothes with elements like fur were not considered a&nbsp;sign of&nbsp;good taste, but instead thought to&nbsp;be&nbsp;quite old-fashioned. That’s why in&nbsp;order to&nbsp;outline Sharon Stone’s character’s wealth, designer Bob Mackie <a href=#>created</a> a&nbsp;semi-transparent golden dress for her. Later it&nbsp;was sold at&nbsp;auction for $13,200.</p><p><h2>The style of&nbsp;the ’90s from Clueless</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/9d3/97d/4c2d3c5281ba6abb4a03974713.jpg><p>After the release of&nbsp;the movie Clueless, this outfit became one of&nbsp;the most popular attributes of ’90s pop culture: a&nbsp;checkered yellow blazer with a&nbsp;skirt and white knee socks. Many <a href=#>fashion mongers</a> still strive to&nbsp;get this look even today. What’s more, the hat of&nbsp;the second main character is&nbsp;on&nbsp;the list of&nbsp;legendary cinematography headdresses.</p><p><h2>The boldness of&nbsp;bright pink from Legally Blonde</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/77e/b16/a4d1cc53fc83d1853273f8262d.jpg><p>Many girls were trying to&nbsp;copy the look of&nbsp;Elle Woods at&nbsp;the beginning of&nbsp;the 2000s&nbsp;— a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;pink colors, a&nbsp;deep neckline, high slit, and a&nbsp;small dog as&nbsp;an&nbsp;accessory. Thanks to&nbsp;this film, pink ceased to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;color that only frivolous girls wear and became trendy again.</p><p><h2>The yellow dress from How to&nbsp;Lose a&nbsp;Guy in&nbsp;10&nbsp;Days</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f62/cb8/7ec887548c9344c0fc3ccb7ebd.jpg><p>Bright yellow outfits were not very popular in&nbsp;the 2000s. But everything changed after the release of&nbsp;the comedy movie How to&nbsp;Lose a&nbsp;Guy in&nbsp;10&nbsp;Days. The light, flowy, cross-strap floor-length dress with a&nbsp;bare back <a href=#>was created</a> by&nbsp;designer Dina Bar-El. The yellow color was chosen to&nbsp;enhance the “Isadora” 84-carat yellow diamond pendant that was worth more than $5&nbsp;million, that the main character was wearing at&nbsp;the gala. After the release of&nbsp;the movie, yellow evening dresses became the center of&nbsp;every girls’ attention. And, of&nbsp;course, it&nbsp;was the model with a&nbsp;cross-strapped back that became extremely popular.</p><p><h2>The style of&nbsp;the ’00s from Mean Girls</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/429/e3f/f44ea7520e85eb37d8c1bc6edf.jpg><p>Continuing the trend of&nbsp;Legally Blonde, Mean Girls also features pink outfits. The movie portrays the main trends of&nbsp;the 2000s style: loose-fitting T-shirts, velvet tracksuits, accessories with colored logos, striped knee socks, baggy sweatshirts, and <a href=# title=eyeliner data-link=tag>eyeliner</a> applied in&nbsp;style of&nbsp;early Avril Lavigne.</p><p><h2>Unconventional fashion styles from The Devil Wears Prada</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/620/295/1c9eb552638031f737fdcd77f2.jpg><p>This movie is&nbsp;<a href=#>abundant</a> with outfits from world-famous brands. In&nbsp;the course of&nbsp;the plot, <a href=# title="Anne Hathaway" data-link=tag>Anne Hathaway</a>’s character changed many looks, which seemingly combine the incongruous. While some people didn’t like these combinations, others started to&nbsp;use those details (like leopard print with bright colors that we&nbsp;can see on&nbsp;the main character’s coat) in&nbsp;real life.</p><p><h2>Sophisticated retro style from the movie Carol</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/852/720/f1c468508a80cb56a90730fcd0.jpg><p>The movie Carol completely immerses the viewer in&nbsp;a&nbsp;retro atmosphere. Cate Blanchett’s look is&nbsp;the embodiment of&nbsp;elegance: scarves tied around the head or&nbsp;neck, watches with thin metal bracelets, large brooches, bright colors, and red lipstick. It&nbsp;is&nbsp;these details that create a&nbsp;feminine and sophisticated look that has been inspiring women all over the world for several years.</p><p><h2>The yellow dress from La&nbsp;La&nbsp;Land</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ed9/4b4/8fe95b5cae94004072b10b063d.jpg><p>After the release of&nbsp;La&nbsp;La&nbsp;Land, it&nbsp;was not just dances that became popular again but the color yellow as&nbsp;well. It&nbsp;was Mia’s bright yellow dress that started the trend&nbsp;— this color was <a href=#>considered</a> to&nbsp;be&nbsp;the “new pink” color for the new millennials in&nbsp;2018.</p><p><h2>The intense and bright style of&nbsp;Renata from the Big Little Lies series</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b47/f80/9643715bbb897f5ff20b495899.jpg><p>Renata is&nbsp;the most stylish character in&nbsp;the series. She demonstrates how clothes can become a&nbsp;symbol of&nbsp;confidence, power, and strength, and an&nbsp;indicator of&nbsp;status. The costume designer Alix Friedberg <a href=#>confessed</a> that she has experimented a&nbsp;lot with this character’s costumes because Renata’s personality allowed&nbsp;it. Her looks are intense, but they have a&nbsp;sense of&nbsp;chic and a&nbsp;shine that makes others go&nbsp;crazy. Her ruby red dress Zodiac by&nbsp;Roland Mouret was <a href=#>searched</a> for on&nbsp;<a href=#>Lyst</a>&nbsp;87% more after its appearance in&nbsp;the series.</p><p>We&nbsp;all know that fashion is&nbsp;cyclic.

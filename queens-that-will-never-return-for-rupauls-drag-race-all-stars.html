Yet, while some divas made it a point to return, not all are convinced to stage a comeback.

Yet, while some divas made it a point to return, not all are convinced to stage a comeback.</strong></p><p>We’ve listed queens that we think would never reappear in Drag Race ever again. From busy schedules to major beef with RuPaul Charles as their reasons, let’s take a look back at them.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Drag Queens That’ll Never Return for RuPaul’s Drag Race All-Stars</h2><h3 class=wp-block-heading>1. Nina West</h3><p>Back in her time on Drag Race season 11, Nina West was undeniably been one of the most friendly queens. Given her kindness on the series, it’s not surprising that she’s become an active advocate of LGBTQIA+ rights, focusing on educating children about the pride community. For this thing alone, West has a valid reason not to return for All-Stars, she’s too busy to werk the runway!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>2. Kim Chi</h2><p>After seizing fame in Drag Race season eight, Kim Chi took the time to launch her own beauty line. For makeup enthusiasts and those who do drag for a living, KimChi Chic Beauty, is one of their go-to brands. Hence, with her being too focused on business, it’s sufficient to say that Kim Chi is not one to come back on the show anytime yet.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>3. Courtney Act</h2><p>Drag Race fans have long been waiting for season six queen, Courtney Act, to appear in the show once more, yet it seems too impossible to happen. It’s no secret that RuPaul and Act aren’t the best of friends, since Act has openly blocked the show’s creator on Twitter. Nevertheless, while Act doesn’t indulge in the drama, she once mentioned that reappearing in the series in not an option as RuPaul and Michelle Visage weren’t really interested in her.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>4. Gigi Goode</h2><p>Being one of the popular fashion queens on Drag Race season 12, fans have been pushing Gigi Goode to grace the series once more. However, the diva has expressly declared in Gay Times that joining again is not included in her plans. Nonetheless, as she said, if <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Drag Race</a> will evolved to a new level, she would be open to return.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>5. Bianca Del Rio</h2><p>Inside and outside the competition, Bianca Del Rio is pretty much a household name in the aspect of drag. Apparently, she’s declined the invitation to the all winners season, stating that she doesn’t want to “go back to high school.” Whether she means good or not, it’s kinda clear that she’s not coming back in the show.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>6. Tamisha Iman</h2><p>Claiming that the entire season 13 was rigged, Tamisha Iman ignited chaos on social media, thus shocking the show itself and its fans. With her publicly castigating Drag Race, it would be a miracle if she would be invited to appear on All-Stars. Iman seemed uninterested as well, given her alleged bad experience back in 2021.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>7. The Vixen</h2><p>The Vixen has attracted quite a number of fans although portrayed as a combative queen during season 10. Additionally, she was famous for walking off the reunion show after feeling offended by RuPaul and other queens. Today though, The Vixen is more focused on activism with Black Girl Magic, thus a tighter space for Drag Race.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>8. Pearl</h2><p>Pearl’s infamous season seven feud with RuPaul, when she said “do I have something on my face?” has probably cemented the unlikelihood of her being casted in All-Stars. To further glue this impossibility, Michelle Visage and RuPaul attacked her on their podcast. This pretty much signifies the panel’s extreme dislike against her.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>9. Max</h2><p>Max has been among the vocal queens who braved the act of exposing the mistreatment they experience during their Drag Race stint. The season seven drag diva has also expressly manifested their disinterest in coming back. Hence, it’s only fair to expect that she’s not appearing in the reality series anytime.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-10-willam>10. Willam</h2><p>Just like any other queen who attempted to expose the misbehaviors of RuPaul’s Drag Race, Willam might not also be the one to return to the show. Willam has stood against the unfair treatment of the show to its queens, detailing her opinion in an NSFW interview. Furthermore, her public feud with RuPaul is also proof that coming back is a bad idea.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Original_TaylorSwift_TheVoice-220x147.jpg alt="The Best Taylor Swift Covers on Talent Shows" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>rupaul's drag race</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>rupaul's drag race all stars</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK570K6cnqajYsGprdNmrqKknGK7psLEq2SrnaSqv695xaipZqqlpa62uNJmm6uZl2K%2Foq%2FEZpilpF2owaK%2B0mg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

We&nbsp;at&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side</strong> always strive to&nbsp;see the positive aspect of&nbsp;things, and we&nbsp;hope that with the advice we’ve compiled for you, you’ll be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;relax and enjoy the arrival of&nbsp;your baby boy.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/6f6/bc8/14c6d858e0b87000f022cd8977.jpg><ul><li><strong>Stand up&nbsp;for yourself and your choices. </strong>You’re the baby’s mother, and you’ll always be&nbsp;there for him, no&nbsp;matter what. When you are more at&nbsp;ease in&nbsp;your role, you will feel more comfortable <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>taking over</a> with your mother-in-law in&nbsp;case she becomes too controlling. Hold firm to&nbsp;your convictions and what you and your partner believe is&nbsp;best for your child; if&nbsp;she truly cares about her grandson, she will eventually follow your lead.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Discuss the situation with your husband.</strong> Every personal relationship requires <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>communication</a>, and being open about your problems and what bothers you the most can only benefit you and your family.<br>Decide together what role your mother-in-law should play. Maybe she could help for an&nbsp;hour or&nbsp;2&nbsp;in&nbsp;the afternoons, then you can take the baby home. Inquire with your husband about how he&nbsp;would handle this. He&nbsp;might talk to&nbsp;your mother-in-law and diplomatically defuse the situation; he&nbsp;can lead the conversation, but make sure you’re involved as&nbsp;well.</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/45d/537/ccc7885669ac9c97b986d1d98e.jpg><ul><li><strong>Establish open and honest <a href=# title=communication data-link=tag>communication</a> with your mother-in-law. </strong>Regardless of&nbsp;the situation, everyone has an&nbsp;opinion, and yours is&nbsp;just as&nbsp;valid as&nbsp;someone else’s. If&nbsp;you don’t talk to&nbsp;your mother-in-law about something that bothers you, she won’t notice. Of&nbsp;course, you both should talk about it&nbsp;pleasantly.<br>Try to&nbsp;have an&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>open dialogue</a> about what irritates you and devise a&nbsp;strategy for resolving the issue and making advances for the sake of&nbsp;the family. If&nbsp;she continues to&nbsp;complain or&nbsp;criticize, hold a&nbsp;positive attitude and kindly say, “Thanks for the advice,” before going about your business.</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a07/b91/840f7d559f8c3b577f3afd5f85.jpg><ul><li><strong>Set boundaries. </strong>If&nbsp;the fact that she’s always around your house irritates you, simply start setting boundaries, regardless of&nbsp;whether she agrees&nbsp;— it’s your home, your rules. Decide where you want to&nbsp;draw the line and stick to&nbsp;it.<br>There are some specific situations where you may want to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>set limits</a>, such as&nbsp;when she comes to&nbsp;visit, activities to&nbsp;do&nbsp;with the grandchild, and family decisions. It’s essential to&nbsp;commit to&nbsp;your limits and communicate with your in-law once you’ve established them. If&nbsp;a&nbsp;boundary is&nbsp;crossed, you may need to&nbsp;set more stringent ones.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Ask for advice from your own family. </strong>No&nbsp;one understands you better than your family, so&nbsp;having them by&nbsp;your side is&nbsp;essential. Your MIL’s actions have outraged your brother and his family, but they will understand how upsetting the situation is&nbsp;for you.<br>Try to&nbsp;communicate openly with him and your parents, expressing your feelings and concerns, asking for their <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>support</a>, and seeing what decisions suit you the best. More importantly, avoid causing friction between your own family and your husband’s; it’s always a&nbsp;joy to&nbsp;see 2&nbsp;families coming together and getting along.</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/661/25d/4252e654658c067b21a157f809.jpg><ul><li><strong>Create family routines.</strong> Setting up&nbsp;a&nbsp;regular time for your family to&nbsp;catch up&nbsp;with your in-laws is&nbsp;a&nbsp;good idea. A&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>regular get-together</a>, whether it’s a&nbsp;weekly Sunday lunch or&nbsp;something else that aligns with your time schedule, can be&nbsp;a&nbsp;special occasion for you and your in-laws to&nbsp;strengthen your relationship. Family routines facilitate people involved in&nbsp;understanding their roles within the family. These routines can also facilitate your child in&nbsp;comprehending his belongings and ties.</li></ul><p>We&nbsp;wish Kate and her family all the best, hoping that our suggestions will assist her in&nbsp;resolving this difficult situation.</p><p>Have you ever had a&nbsp;similar experience with your in-laws?

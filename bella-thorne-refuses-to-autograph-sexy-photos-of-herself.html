The actress said she told off an autograph seeker who presented her with risqué photos of herself, including some from when she was underage.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-bella-thorne-won-t-sign-sexy-photos-of-herself>Bella Thorne Won’t Sign Sexy Photos of Herself</h2><p>In a recent interview with the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Hollywood Reporter</a>, Thorne said she told off a man who wanted her to sign sexy photos of herself, including one from a GQ magazine photoshoot she did. The man was persistent, even after she said she didn’t want to sign the photos.</p><p>“I didn’t like it. It was inappropriate,” Thorne said. “There was some stuff there from a Candies campaign that I did when I was 16 and it was clear that he wanted me to sign things that were viewed as sexy and even underage and I was like, ‘Give me something else.’ He said, ‘Aren’t they all sexy?’ No, enough is enough.”</p><p>Thorne added that she understands that autograph seekers “have to make money and everyone has a job,” but she shared, “It was just that I was under 18 and it’s inappropriate.”</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO:</strong> <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">BELLA THORNE SHARES TRAILER FOR MOVIE SEQUEL WITH EX BENJAMIN MASCOLO</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-thorne-says-she-wouldn-t-pose-for-those-photos-now>Thorne Says She Wouldn’t Pose For Those Photos Now</h2><p>When asked if she ever rethinks some of the photos she took in the past, Thorne responded, “Yeah, definitely, but it’s just that, I wouldn’t do that now. You also can’t spend your time trying to take back these moments or moments that you were too sexy or think that being a woman is only this or that.”</p><p>Thorne added that she’s working on a short film “about growing up and being told from a very young age or by experiences that life as a woman means that people are either going to take something from you or you’re going to give it to them.”</p><p>Earlier this year, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Thorne spoke out</a> about her experiences as a child actor, saying a director accused her of flirting with him when she was 10 years old. She also shared that she was almost fired by Disney at age 14 for wearing a bikini at the beach.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Original_LindsayArnold-220x147.jpg alt="Fans Are Convinced Lindsay Arnold is Having Twins After Accidental Typo" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>bella thorne</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57wZ6jpZldqbWwvs2eZKudlqrApr%2BMraZmmaWpvKi%2BwKmfZquVrcZuvMeoq6irXaSzbrTEq6qepJZk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

Certainly the brand is not performing in the same way it did during late 1990s, in which t-shirts emblazoned with the ‘FCUK’ slogan were ubiquitous around the country.</p><p>There is speculation that founder Stephen Marks could sell his share of the company. Sport’s Direct founder Mike Ashley currently holds a 27% stake.</p><p>YouGov BrandIndex data shows where the brand has struggled in recent years, especially against ‘fast-fashion’ rivals, and those that trade exclusively online.</p><p>Of the 56 brands that YouGov tracks in the high-street fashion sector, French Connection finds itself in 47h place in terms of value for money score (-6) among the general public. Brands such as Zara (+5), H&M (+17) have healthier scores on this metric.</p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/FCUK.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>However, when we consider French Connection’s Impression score (whether someone has a positive or negative impression of a brand), we see it is actually quite healthy (+9). It does however lag behind Zara (+16) and H&M (+21) on this metric.</p><p>Another positive is that consumers tend to view French Connection as producing good quality products. Its Quality score currently stands at +16, which does compare well to its high-street rivals. Indeed it is 14th in our list of fashion brands on this rating.</p><p>This may indicate that while French Connection is generally well-liked – possibly due to the strong brand awareness and connection with customers it achieved in its heyday, potential shoppers are being attracted by cheaper prices offered by other mid-market companies.</p><p>Whether a new buyer emerges remains to be seen, but naturally it will face a steep challenge in returning the brand to its former glories, especially in the face of well-documented challenges that are facing the high-street retail industry at the moment.</p><p>Image Getty</p><p>This article originally appeared in City A.M.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmixn6q0sMKNnKZnrZtksLC60q6knqpflr%2B1tcKlnKxnYmaEc4OMn6meppOdeqS7zaecnKyZpLtur86nqqKclafAbr%2FApZxmr5iav6Z5x5qqZpqilrulecU%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

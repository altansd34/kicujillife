You may either use seed kernels or the leaves of the plant.</p><p class=align-left>Oil extracted from the seed kernels is cold-pressed and is considered to be the most effective. However, unless you have a factory, it is quite impossible to get neem oil extract from seed kernels. The only way out is by using leaves.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/f24a5a8021a60ae6.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Five best ways on how to remove adhesive from skin</span></p></a><p class=align-left>There are three ways to get the essence of the neem plant that you need. Two ways involve additional oils and in the end, you will receive new oil, and the third one requires water extract. That is, the essential neem oil will be dissolved in water. All these neem oil extraction methods are pretty easy and you won’t need any special equipment or skills.</p><h3>Nem oil cold preparation</h3><p class=align-left>You will need a glass jar with a tight lid, clean coconut oil, and fresh neem leaves.</p><p class=align-left>The process is as follows:</p><ul><li>Wash the leaves thoroughly and make sure there are no sand or soil particles</li><li>Remove excess water carefully with a paper towel and let the leaves dry for several minutes until the water evaporates completely</li><li>Put them into a clean dry glass jar. Choose the size in such a way that the leaves don’t fill it to the brim. There should be enough space inside the jar</li><li>Pour in the clean coconut oil. Make sure the oil covers the leaves</li><li>Cover the jar with the lid and set aside for two weeks. The jar should be stored at room temperature and away from direct sunlight. Direct sun rays can destroy everything in a matter of minutes</li><li>In two weeks, open the lid and filter the oil into a separate jar or bowl. This is how you get the neem infused coconut oil. However, such a delicate method will provide you with only a little part of the essential oil that can be found in the neem leaves</li><li>Store the oil in a tightly covered jar in a cool place as far away from the direct sunlight as possible and try to use it within some three to four months. This is the longest storage time under proper conditions for neem oil of this type</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/86ee163bcdc0fc51.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Using palm kernel oil for glowing and healthy light skin</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/f24a5a8021a60ae6.jpg><h3>Neem oil hot infusion</h3><p class=align-left>Here, you will need the following: fresh neem leaves (possibly with stems), coconut oil, a good saucepan, and a sieve for filtering out the end product.</p><p class=align-left>The details of the process look like this:</p><ul><li>Wash the neem leaves and, again, remove excess water with a paper towel or just let the water evaporate naturally.</li><li>Pour a generous amount of coconut oil into a saucepan and heat it up. Coconut oil is slightly milky when it’s cold but loses this colour while being heated. You need to heat it up until it’s completely transparent</li><li>In the meanwhile, grind the neem leaves with the help of a blender or a grinder. You will get a thick paste with particles of leaves and stems</li><li>When the oil is transparent, add the neem paste and stir immediately. Let the mixture boil, stirring it constantly and thoroughly</li><li>When it boils, reduce the fire and keep on cooking for several minutes more. When you can see that the liquid in the saucepan is green, turn the fire off</li><li>Filter the oil into a clean and dry glass jar with a tight lid. Press the residue out very carefully: you don’t want to lose the expensive oil, do you?</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/eb2d4a774006b069.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How olive oil is made: step by step guide</span></p></a><p class=align-left>This is how you prepare neem infused coconut oil easily. The percentage of the neem essence in this mixture is much higher than in the previous example. You can apply this oil as it is or even dissolve it with some neutral basic oils to reduce the concentration</p><p class=align-left>Store in a cool place, don’t expose to direct sunlight and this extract will serve you for several months</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/86ee163bcdc0fc51.jpg><h3>Neem water extract</h3><p class=align-left>You will need, as usually, neem leaves and stems, some water, a big saucepan for boiling, and a sieve for filtering. As long as the water extracts of the neem essential oil are not used for, say, cosmetic or medicinal purposes, you do not have to worry much about the cleanness of the leaves.</p><p class=align-left>The point is that the water extraction method is used to prepare neem oil used as a natural organic pesticide for a garden. The neem essential oil that goes into the water while boiling is a perfect repellent not only for the garden but also for pets who need to be protected from ticks, mosquitos, and other insects.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt4n05knc06df.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>The best recipe of soursop leaves tea is here</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The process is as simple as this:</p><ul><li>Take the leaves from the stems and put them into the bowl together. Add enough water to cover the leaves and stems.</li><li>Put the bowl onto a low fire and gradually let the water boil. When it boils thoroughly, reduce the fire and cover the bowl with a lid. Keep on boiling the leaves for 5 more minutes.</li><li>5 minutes are enough to transmit everything useful from the leaves into the water. Remove the bowl from the fire and let it cool down</li><li>When the liquid is not scalding hot anymore, remove the leaves from the water with your hands, squeezing the leaves tightly to press out the remaining essential oil</li><li>Then, filter the water into a jar or bottle with a tight lid to remove particles of leaves or so</li></ul><p class=align-left>Spray over the garden plants with the help of special tools in generous amounts.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt5msrsu0fc2m.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Industrial and home ways of extracting avocado oil</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/f6f32ef133b964b8.jpg><h2>Bonus: Homemade neem oil for hair and scalp issues</h2><p class=align-left>The ingredients are practically the same: neem leaves, some base oil (coconut or sesame). However, it’s recommended to add fresh basil leaves, too, as their effect on hair and scalp is amazing. The remedy works for hair strengthening, to repel lice and kill their larvae, to get rid of scalp inflammations, and to make hair shiny.</p><p class=align-left>The process of preparation is the same as the hot infusion. Grind washed neem and basil leaves and add them to the boiling base oil. Let the mixture boil for 15 minutes and then remove from the fire and allow it to rest for 2 hours or more.</p><p class=align-left>Filter the liquid into a glass jar and cover with a tight lid.

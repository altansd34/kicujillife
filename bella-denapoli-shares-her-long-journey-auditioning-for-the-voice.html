The singer didn’t give up on her dream of appearing on the show, eventually making it through to Ariana Grande’s team.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-bella-denapoli-shares-the-voice-audition-journey>Bella DeNapoli Shares The Voice Audition Journey</h2><p>Bella shared in her <a href=#>TikTok</a> video that her The Voice journey started when she waited in line for four hours at a New York City open call when she was 16 years old. She added that she was “wearing a picnic table dress.” They apparently told her to come back the next year.</p><p>So she returned the next year and received a callback the same day to sing again. She chose to sing “Listen” by Beyoncé, which she thought was “an original choice.” She was told that the show would “be in touch.”</p><p>Next time, she submitted an audition online and was pushed to the final round before the Blind Auditions. She went the rock route and sang “Bring Me to Life” by Evanescence. The show told her to “come back next time.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-bella-eventually-made-it-onto-team-ariana>Bella Eventually Made it Onto Team Ariana</h2><p>Bella said she ended up being put on a standby email list for another three seasons. She explained that she had “to retry out each time and wait for the executives to believe in me.” It finally happened, after seven auditions.</p><p>The singer received an email letting her know that the show would be flying her out to Los Angeles to appear on the first season with Ariana Grande as a coach. For her Blind Audition, she sang “Damaged” by Danity Kane, turning three chairs.</p><p>Bella joined Team Ariana and made it to the Live Playoffs, where she was eliminated after failing to secure the Instant Save vote. However, she’s grateful for the opportunity. She wrote on TikTok that she’ll be thanking The Voice and Grande “for the rest of my life.”</p><p>Since appearing on the show last year, Bella has <a href=#>released her debut album</a>, titled Three Letters. She also recently joined Season 21 winners Girl Named Tom on <a href=#>two New York tour stops</a>.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Original_KeithUrban_RoyRochlin_GettyImages.jpg alt="Keith Urban Helps Couple with Gender Reveal During Concert" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>Bella DeNapoli</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>The Voice</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57wZ6jpZldmbKvrc%2Boo6Jlo52us7HSZp%2Beql2hvK%2BzjKOmrqqemsZurdSdoK2hn6O2r7OMn6arZaSdsm7CzqKanmc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

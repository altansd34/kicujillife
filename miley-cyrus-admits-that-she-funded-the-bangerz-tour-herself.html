This tour, which raked in an impressive $63 million, seemed like a massive success story. However, in a recent statement shared through her TikTok series “Used to be Young,” Cyrus disclosed a surprising twist.

It was an era of experimentation, rebellion, and artistic exploration for the young artist. However, Cyrus admitted that her creative ideas were so “outlandish” that she struggled to find support from others in the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">industry</a>.</p><p>Despite the criticism and skepticism, she persevered, stating, “The Bangerz tour was an investment in myself.” One of the defining characteristics of the “Bangerz” tour was the extravagant stage design and props. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Cyrus</a> went all out with oversized beds, and big puppets, and even emerged from a giant model of her own tongue.</p><p>She wanted to conclude the show with a reference to The Truman Show, a film starring Jim Carrey, by flying out on a giant hotdog and exiting through the clouds and an oversized exit sign. This ambitious creative vision required substantial financial resources.</p><p>Despite the financial risks and lack of industry support, she remained determined to provide her fans with an exceptional experience. Her perseverance successfully paid off, with the Bangers Tour becoming the highest-grossing tour of her career.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-miley-cyrus-said-it-s-an-investment-for-herself>Miley Cyrus said It’s an Investment for Herself</h2><p>Cyrus’ decision to self-fund the “Bangerz” tour might seem unconventional, especially given the tour’s success and revenue. The tour grossed over $62 million, making it the 16th highest-grossing tour of the year.</p><p>“I didn’t make a dime on this tour because I wanted the tour to be excellent.” Cyrus said. “And when everyone kept saying: “Why are you doing this? You’re going to do, like, 100 shows and you’re not going to make any money?” I said: “There’s no one I would rather invest in than myself.””</p><p>It’s essential to remember that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Cyrus</a> was only 20 and 21 years old during this period. She faced a barrage of criticism and body-shaming for her artistic choices, which were often seen as a departure from her Disney Channel persona.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Original_CharliDAmelio_MarkBallas_ABC_Raymond-Liu-220x172.jpg alt="Charli D’Amelio Reveals ‘DWTS’ Affected The Whole Family on ‘The D’Amelio Show’ Trailer" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57zKKjnrFdmMazwdJmmJ2lmanAbsDHmqtmq5iaeqfBzZ2cnWWknbJursCnnp6qqmLBsMHRZp%2BeqqOauad7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

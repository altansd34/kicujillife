The woman happened to&nbsp;find a&nbsp;very untypical thing for men in&nbsp;her husband’s belongings, and these were 2&nbsp;menstrual pads. Of&nbsp;course, Ava was shocked because of&nbsp;this finding and confronted her husband about&nbsp;it, but she could never even imagine the real truth hiding behind this seemingly innocent hygienic product.</p><p><h2>Ava decided to&nbsp;do&nbsp;her husband a&nbsp;small favor and unpacked his suitcase after his business trip.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f67/9a7/95c32e56b498dcdfe0d42a827f.jpg><p>Ava, 34, asked&nbsp;us to&nbsp;publish her story, because she thought her example would be&nbsp;a&nbsp;good lesson for other people to&nbsp;trust their gut.</p><p>The woman opened her letter, saying, “My&nbsp;husband and&nbsp;I have been happily married for over 10&nbsp;years now. Throughout all our <a href=# title=marriage data-link=tag>marriage</a>, there wasn’t a&nbsp;single reason for me&nbsp;not to&nbsp;trust him, or&nbsp;for him to&nbsp;think that I’m lying or&nbsp;unfaithful. Our <a href=# title=relationship data-link=tag>relationship</a> has always been crystal clear, we&nbsp;built it&nbsp;based on&nbsp;mutual respect and trust. I&nbsp;did love this man with all my&nbsp;heart, well, I&nbsp;still&nbsp;do. But the recent events in&nbsp;our family made me&nbsp;want to&nbsp;throw him away from our house and make him forget the way home.”</p><p>Ava goes on&nbsp;with her story, saying, “My&nbsp;husband works a&nbsp;lot. I&nbsp;mean, he’s a&nbsp;real workaholic, who literally lives in&nbsp;his office, coming home only to&nbsp;have dinner and to&nbsp;spend a&nbsp;night. I&nbsp;always missed him so&nbsp;much because of&nbsp;this, but&nbsp;I adjusted to&nbsp;his careerism and his ambitions to&nbsp;grow in&nbsp;his sphere. He&nbsp;had a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;business trips recently, all of&nbsp;them related to&nbsp;their new huge business project.<br>Two weeks ago, he&nbsp;returned from one of&nbsp;such business trip. He&nbsp;entered the house, kissed me&nbsp;and put his suitcase near the entrance. He&nbsp;was going to&nbsp;have a&nbsp;day off that day, and he&nbsp;was about to&nbsp;unpack&nbsp;it, when suddenly he&nbsp;got an&nbsp;urgent call from his office. He&nbsp;told me&nbsp;that there was an&nbsp;urgent matter, but he&nbsp;would be&nbsp;back soon, and rushed to&nbsp;the office. I&nbsp;decided to&nbsp;unpack his suitcase instead of&nbsp;him. And God, I&nbsp;was astonished with what&nbsp;I saw there!”</p><p><h2>The woman made a&nbsp;shocking finding in&nbsp;her husband’s belongings.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/dc2/bf1/88c6fa573f8596bd8728c3bf75.jpg><p>Ava goes on&nbsp;with her story, saying, “There were 2&nbsp;unused menstrual pads hidden between my&nbsp;husband’s dirty shirts. I&nbsp;found them accidentally, while sorting his clothes before&nbsp;I would put the dirty ones into the laundry. To&nbsp;say that&nbsp;I was shocked is&nbsp;to&nbsp;say nothing. Because, well, I&nbsp;instantly had this gut feeling that this wasn’t an&nbsp;accident, but&nbsp;I couldn’t find any reasonable explanation for this.”</p><p>Ava continues, saying, “When my&nbsp;husband got back home, in&nbsp;about 2&nbsp;hours, he&nbsp;immediately asked me&nbsp;where his suitcase was. I&nbsp;told him that&nbsp;I unpacked it&nbsp;and his dirty clothes are already being washed. He&nbsp;pretended to&nbsp;be&nbsp;calm about the situation, as&nbsp;if&nbsp;there was nothing to&nbsp;hide.<br>Then, I&nbsp;confronted him about the menstrual pads that I&nbsp;found. When I&nbsp;asked him about these, he&nbsp;went pale for a&nbsp;moment, but then he&nbsp;regained his composure and said that he&nbsp;was keeping those for his colleague, who had her period while on&nbsp;a&nbsp;business trip with him, and he&nbsp;just wanted to&nbsp;be&nbsp;supportive and progressive about attitude to&nbsp;periods.”</p><p>Ava said, “I&nbsp;don’t know why, but&nbsp;I didn’t believe a&nbsp;word of&nbsp;it. I&nbsp;still had this gut feeling that something was extremely wrong, but there was no&nbsp;suitable explanation, so&nbsp;I decided to&nbsp;leave this topic for a&nbsp;while.”</p><p><h2>Another revelation came unexpectedly after the incident with pads.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e37/074/48e7335623ba4065c8c23c78a4.jpg><p>Ava continues, saying, “A&nbsp;week has passed after this pity accident, when&nbsp;I got another shocking revelation. This time, my&nbsp;husband forgot his phone at&nbsp;home, because he&nbsp;was in&nbsp;a&nbsp;hurry to&nbsp;his office in&nbsp;the morning. He&nbsp;overslept and didn’t hear the alarm clock, so&nbsp;he&nbsp;was really in&nbsp;a&nbsp;hurry and just left the phone on&nbsp;the table in&nbsp;our living room. I&nbsp;was passing this table and looked at&nbsp;his phone. There was a&nbsp;text message from some ’Anna Work’, that was saying, ’Do our plan with the plumber go&nbsp;down the drain?’”</p><p>The woman wrote, “I&nbsp;found this message weird, like, what plan, what plumber, what was it&nbsp;all about? When my&nbsp;husband came home to&nbsp;pick his phone, I&nbsp;didn’t say anything, I&nbsp;decided to&nbsp;wait till he&nbsp;comes back from work in&nbsp;the evening and have a&nbsp;serious talk with him.”</p><p>When Ava’s husband came home, the woman insisted that she wanted an&nbsp;explanation. But he&nbsp;wouldn’t say anything. Then, Ava took his phone from his hands, opened the messages with ’Anna Work’ and started reading them all, aloud.</p><p><h2>The woman finally found out what her husband’s plan was.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/967/407/5da79d5e2e935d1890fcffddec.jpg><p>While reading the messages, Ava gradually discovered that her husband and his colleague were having an&nbsp;affair. The woman said, “While I&nbsp;was reading and getting the confirmation that he&nbsp;was unfaithful, I&nbsp;only felt relieved, because yes, I&nbsp;did suspect him of&nbsp;cheating, and now everything was clearing&nbsp;up.”</p><p>But the most disgusting revelation was still ahead. Ava goes&nbsp;on, saying, “These menstrual pads that&nbsp;I found in&nbsp;his suitcase, they did belong to&nbsp;his colleague. She gave these to&nbsp;him, because they were the <a href=# title=part data-link=tag>part</a> of&nbsp;their sick plan. As&nbsp;soon as&nbsp;they needed a&nbsp;place for their romantic meetings, and&nbsp;I was constantly at&nbsp;home, they decided to&nbsp;get rid of&nbsp;me&nbsp;for a&nbsp;day or&nbsp;two.<br>She gave him these pads and told him he&nbsp;must flush them down our toilet. Then, it&nbsp;would get clogged. My&nbsp;husband would blame me&nbsp;of&nbsp;washing the pads down the toilet and then would ask me&nbsp;to&nbsp;leave for a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;days and live at&nbsp;my&nbsp;parents’, until he&nbsp;arranges our toilet to&nbsp;be&nbsp;fixed by&nbsp;a&nbsp;plumber.”</p><p>Ava added, “The plan was, to&nbsp;some extent, a&nbsp;genius one. They would play on&nbsp;my&nbsp;sense of&nbsp;guilt, and they expected me&nbsp;to&nbsp;be&nbsp;ashamed of&nbsp;what&nbsp;I did (flushed the pad down the toilet), and then they would just get rid of&nbsp;me, painlessly, for a&nbsp;day or&nbsp;even two!<br>Now, I&nbsp;kicked my&nbsp;husband out of&nbsp;the house instead. He’s bombarding me&nbsp;with calls, asking me&nbsp;not to&nbsp;leave him. But I&nbsp;feel so&nbsp;much disgusted by&nbsp;this dirty intrigue that&nbsp;I love and hate him at&nbsp;the same time.”</p><p>And here’s yet another mind-boggling story of&nbsp;a&nbsp;woman, who found <a href=#>tampons</a> in&nbsp;her husband’s car. They weren’t hers, and she was sure he&nbsp;was cheating on&nbsp;her. But when she discovered the real truth behind these tampons, she wished he’d been cheating better than turning out to&nbsp;be&nbsp;such a&nbsp;creep.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLZuss6upZ1lYmK6prrSramumZxivaKw0magp2WdrnqpwdKbmKeco2KvprjOp56ippeoeqK6w2akmpyVYq5uv8eomqShnpx6pbXSnKavnaKueqKuzq6rZqCZonp5fZdxcHBn</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

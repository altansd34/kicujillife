In English, we have subject pronouns and object pronouns, both of which we’re focusing on today. Personal pronouns can stand in for all types of nouns in a sentence. 
Common personal pronouns in English are: “I,” “you,” “he,” “she,” “it,” “we,” “they,” “me,” “you,” “him,” “her,” “it,” “us” and “them.” Let’s learn more about the difference between subject and object pronouns and see some examples of how to use them."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

In <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">English</a>, we have subject pronouns and object pronouns, both of which we’re focusing on today. Personal pronouns can stand in for all types of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">nouns</a> in a sentence.&nbsp;</p><p>Common personal pronouns in English are: “I,” “you,” “he,” “she,” “it,” “we,” “they,” “me,” “you,” “him,” “her,” “it,” “us” and “them.” Let’s learn more about the difference between subject and object pronouns and see some examples of how to use them.&nbsp;</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Subject-pronouns>Subject pronouns</h2><p>Subject pronouns are pronouns that are used as the subject of a sentence. We use them to replace the name of the person or thing that is performing the action in the sentence. The seven subject pronouns are “I,” “you,” “he,” “she,” “it,” “we” and “they.” Here are some example sentences:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Aline went to the store. → <strong>She</strong> went to the store.</li><li>Fred works in New York. → <strong>He</strong> works in New York.&nbsp;</li><li>Ben and Bill love gardening. → <strong>They</strong> love gardening.</li><li><strong>I</strong> often have eggs for lunch.&nbsp;</li><li>Do <strong>you</strong> like learning English?</li><li><strong>We</strong> are going to be late!&nbsp;</li></ul><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Object-pronouns>Object pronouns</h2><p>Object pronouns stand in for the object of a verb or preposition. We use them to replace the name of the person or thing that is receiving the action in the sentence. Some common object pronouns in English include “me,” “you,” “him,” “her,” “it,” “us,” and “them.” Here are some example sentences:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Catch the ball! → Catch<strong> it</strong>!&nbsp;</li><li>I saw Dennis yesterday. → I saw <strong>him</strong> yesterday.</li><li>Please give the flowers to Elena. → Please give <strong>them</strong> to <strong>her</strong>.&nbsp;</li><li>Are you talking to <strong>me</strong>?</li><li>The teacher told <strong>you</strong> to stop talking.&nbsp;</li><li>Mary asked <strong>us</strong> to feed the cat while she was away.&nbsp;</li></ul><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Personal-pronouns-chart>Personal pronouns chart</h2><p>Here is a personal pronouns chart showing the English subject and object pronouns.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-table is-style-stripes"><table><tbody readability=1><tr><td></td><td><strong>Subject pronoun</strong></td><td><strong>Object pronoun</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>First-person singular</strong></td><td>I</td><td>me</td></tr><tr readability=2><td><strong>Second-person singular and plural</strong></td><td>you</td><td>you</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Third-person singular</strong></td><td>he/she/it</td><td>him/her/it</td></tr><tr><td><strong>First-person plural</strong></td><td>we</td><td>us</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Third-person plural</strong></td><td>they</td><td>them</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Gender-neutral-pronouns>Gender-neutral pronouns</h2><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Gender-neutral pronouns</a> are becoming more common in English. You will often hear one person being referred to as “they” or “them,” which are traditionally plural subject pronouns. Make sure you use the correct form of the verb if you use “they.”&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Henry is coming. → <strong>They are</strong> coming.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>It’salso becoming common to use “they” to avoid identifying someone by gender. This can be especially useful when you don’t know someone’s gender. This is less common in very formal writing.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Please look for your teacher in the hall. <strong>They</strong> will be waiting for you.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Animals-and-pets>Animals and pets</h2><p>Lots of English learners are not sure which personal pronoun to use for animals. Generally, we use “it” to talk about animals.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Look at that mouse! <strong>It </strong>is eating cheese.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>However, if we’re talking about a pet, particularly a dog or cat that we love, we often use “he,” “she,” “him” or “her.”&nbsp;</p><ul><li>I adore my dog Charlie. <strong>He</strong>’s my best friend.&nbsp;</li><li>My cat Penny is so cuddly. <strong>She</strong> loves falling asleep on my knee.&nbsp;</li></ul><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Common-errors>Common errors</h2><p>A common error involves confusing English <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">first-person pronouns</a>. This is a mistake that even native speakers make very often. It involves using “me” instead of “I” or “I” instead of “me.” It usually happens when there is more than one subject or object in a sentence.&nbsp;</p><p>Consider the following sentences. The first sentence is incorrect, and the second is correct:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>Me and Sally</strong> want to go shopping this afternoon. (incorrect) → <strong>Sally and I</strong> want to go shopping this afternoon. (correct)&nbsp;</li><li>You can help <strong>Matt and I </strong>later (incorrect). → You can help <strong>Matt and me</strong> later. (correct)&nbsp;</li></ul><p>To ensure you don’t make this mistake, just remove the second subject. You’ll immediately notice that the incorrect first-person pronoun sounds weird:</p><ul><li><strong>Me</strong> want to go shopping this afternoon.</li><li>You can help <strong>I </strong>later.</li></ul><p>These sentences are clearly incorrect when Sally and Matt are removed.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Using personal pronouns&nbsp;</h2><p>Do you feel more confident about using personal pronouns now? You can use the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">English pronouns chart</a> in this article to remember which are the subject pronouns and which are the object pronouns. Remember that subject pronouns can replace the noun that performs the action in a sentence, and object pronouns can replace the noun that receives the action. And don’t make the common mistake of mixing up your first-person pronouns!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.lingoda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Laura-1.jpg><h2>Laura Jones</h2><p>Laura is a freelance writer and was an ESL teacher for eight years.

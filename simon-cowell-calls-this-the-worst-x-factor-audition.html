Simon Cowell even called it “the worst audition.” Check out Lester’s viral 2007 audition gone bad down below.</strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-rachel-lester-delivered-worst-audition-simon-cowell-has-seen>Rachel Lester Delivered ‘Worst Audition’ Simon Cowell Has Seen</h2><p>“I’ve got The X Factor because I am a natural talent,” a confident Lester said before her audition. “At the end of the day, I deserve it. I’m just too goddamn good.”</p><p>Lester began her audition by strutting into the audition room and posing in front of the judges. When Sharon Osbourne asked her what she did for a living, she hilariously responded, “nothing I’m lazy at the moment.”</p><p>This was genuinely such a relatable response, but not one the judges were prepared for.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">CONTESTANT SLAMS MICROPHONE IN ANGER AFTER SIMON COWELL’S HARSH COMMENTS</a></strong></p><p>At the time of her audition, Lester claimed to have been singing all of her life. She even rated herself a 10 on a 10-point scale regarding how good she is at singing.</p><p>She even boasted to the judges that she could sing any song they requested. It was when she claimed that she was a better singer than Madonna that the judges began to question her confidence level.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-lester-s-performance-was-not-a-hit-with-the-judges>Lester’s Performance Was Not a Hit With the Judges</h3><p>Lester performed a rendition of “Sugar Walls” by Sheena Easton, which left the judges speechless — and not in a good way. Cowell pointed out that Lester had a “really bad attitude” from the start.</p><p>This isn’t the first time that Cowell has called out a contestant for having a bad attitude. Check out the compilation below featuring ten of the rudest talent show contestants that challenged the judges.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>“Everything I wouldn’t want, lazy, deluded, very little talent,” Cowell said to Lester who cursed at him multiple times as he gave this negative critique.</p><p>She honestly might have set the record for the most words bleeped out on The X Factor. The two continued a verbal sparring match until Lester refused to leave the room. Security was then called to escort her out.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">‘X FACTOR UK’ SINGER THREATENS TO PUNCH JUDGE AFTER FAILED AUDITION</a></strong></p><p>Lester continued to curse about the judges’ harsh critiques.

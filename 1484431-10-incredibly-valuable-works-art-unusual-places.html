This painting was just under another pile of art in the dusty garage.</p><p class=align-left>After this incident, Levine could not rest until he could prove that the painting was real. He hired a borderline hunt to prove the authenticity of the painting.</p><p class=align-left>Levine also hired a private investigator to learn more about Gordon's history.

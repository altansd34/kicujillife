This talented young star auditioned for the show on season 11, where she showed off her skills as a contortionist. She placed in the top 10 that year before returning for <a href=#>America’s Got Talent: The Champions</a>. The self-taught contortionist has been making waves ever since.</strong></p><p>Sofie has become insanely popular since her time on the show. Today, the performer has a whopping 4.1 million followers on Instagram and 10.2 million followers on TikTok. Sofie also posts regularly on her successful YouTube channel for her <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">6.32 million subscribers</a>.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-sofie-dossi-on-youtube>Sofie Dossi on YouTube</h2><p>Sofie’s YouTube channel features the star as she takes on a number of dares. In one challenge, Sofie literally jumped off a bridge into a body of water. The video alone earned over 11 million views. Part two to the video performed even better, with a whopping 14 million. The channel also features unique 24 hour challenges such as: “Spending 24 Hours in the Air,” and “Surviving 24 Hours in the Ocean Bent in Half.”</p><p>Do Not Try This at Home!</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>Sofie also sprinkles in a number of popular dance videos on her channel. Her original dance music video to Marshmello and Ann-Marie’s “Friends” raked in over 127 million views on her channel. Other popular dance videos include her interpretation of <a href=#>Ariana Grande’s</a> “7 Rings” and “My Boy” by Billie Eilish.</p><p>Sofie also thrives on TikTok, featuring a page full of viral content. In this space, she shows off her flexibility, comedy, and dancing in the short-form videos.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-sofie-on-america-s-got-talent>Sofie on America’s Got Talent</h2><p>The contortionist and hand balancer auditioned for America’s Got Talent on season 11. Just 14-years-old at the time, her tricks consisted of bending her knees over her head and balancing on one hand. She even used her free hand to take a bite out of an apple for some extra flare.</p><p>Finally, while in a handstand position, she shot a bow and arrow with her feet, hitting a target at a distance. In the voting process, all three judges gave a “yes,” sending her through to the next round.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>In the Judge Cuts, Sofie hung on an elevated hoop as she shot a flaming arrow from a bow with her feet. At this stage, she performed well enough to earn the <a href=#>Golden Buzzer</a> from the guest judge, sending her straight to the Quarterfinals. Ultimately, she made it to the finale where she performed a series of aerial tricks. Unfortunately, she did not receive enough votes to be included in the top five, eliminating her from the competition.</p><p>However, that was not the last we would see from Sofie on the AGT stage. The performer returned for The Champions and made it to the preliminary stage. Just a few months ago, Sofie returned once again to pay a visit to the set. She documented the experience on her YouTube channel as she had fun with the judges and <a href=#>Terry Crews</a>. In a cute segment, she even challenged the host to a strength contest.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/thumbnail_PhotoByTheVoice_Facebook.jpeg alt="All of the Season 21 ‘The Voice’ Coach Gifts Ranked" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>America's Got Talent</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>sofie dossi</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK570qidop1dmby0v8hmpp9lkaKys7XCmqpmn5%2BperWty56lrWWnnbKzsYyiqmarmJp6r7vWaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

In June, it was announced that he will take over hosting duties on Wheel of Fortune, when Pat Sajak retires in 2024.

His charisma and familiarity with audiences across America made him a natural choice to succeed Sajak.</p><p>Seacrest will take over full-time hosting duties on Wheel of Fortune when Sajak’s last episode airs in early 2024. In the meantime, Seacrest continues his hosting responsibilities on two other hit shows.</p><p>In addition to his new <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Wheel of Fortune</a> gig, Seacrest will be back for his hosting Dick Clark’s New Year’s Rockin’ Eve on December 31, 2023. He took over hosting responsibilities for the annual celebration in 2005 and helped continue the tradition of a musical lineup.</p><p>Last year’s broadcast attracted nearly 14 million viewers and Seacrest will surely draw a big audience again this year. In a 2022 interview, he reflected on how much the hosting job has meant to him over the years.</p><p>The 2023 edition will kick off at 8 PM Eastern time on December 31 on ABC. Music acts and celebrity appearances will be announced at a later date.</p><p>After nearly 30 years working together, Seacrest and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">iHeartMedia</a> announced in November 2023 that they extended their partnership through the end of 2027. The new deal means Seacrest will continue hosting his popular Los Angeles morning radio show as well as the nationally syndicated programs On Air with Ryan Seacrest and American Top 40.</p><p>Seacrest first began working with iHeartMedia (formerly Clear Channel Communications) as a young radio DJ in Atlanta. His talents were noticed by LA radio stations and soon Seacrest became a household name across the country. He now holds a rare place as one of the most popular and recognizable voices in both radio and television.</p><p>“iHeartMedia has been my home since my teenage years,” Seacrest said. “I’m honored to continue to work together to find new and innovative ways to connect with our listeners.”</p><p>His daily morning show on Los Angeles station KIIS-FM draws big audiences. As do his two syndicated radio programs which reach millions of listeners nationwide. As part of the new deal, Seacrest will continue to collaborate closely with iHeartMedia’s executives and host the iHeartRadio Music Festival as well as Jingle Ball concerts.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Original_XochitlGomez_Valchmerkovskiy_win_Disney_Eric-McCandless-220x147.jpg alt="‘DWTS’ Winners Xochitl Gomez, Val Chmerkovskiy React to Winning the Mirroball" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK570bKYp2Wjmq6kvsSsq2akkaOxtHnHoqpmrJiev6V5zJqhqKpdqcNusMSao2aen6d6c3yRbGY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

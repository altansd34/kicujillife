But she soon got a&nbsp;role in&nbsp;the independent comedy-drama <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Junebug</i></a> (2005), where she played a&nbsp;chatty expectant mother. She made a&nbsp;breakthrough performance for which she was nominated for an&nbsp;Academy Award.</p><p><h2>Recently, her fans noticed some weight gain.</h2></p><p>While most of&nbsp;her fans believed Adams gained weight for some of&nbsp;her film roles, that wasn’t always the case. Instead, she altered her appearance for movies that needed&nbsp;it, using prosthetic parts. The actress <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>admitted</a> that she wanted to&nbsp;be&nbsp;present in&nbsp;every minute of&nbsp;her life, even if&nbsp;she put on&nbsp;weight when she was pregnant.

Adams noted that she started working out and eating a&nbsp;healthy diet after giving birth. She <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>admitted</a>, though, that getting her body back was not her first goal. The mother of&nbsp;one went on&nbsp;to&nbsp;say that she didn’t believe that her “rockin’” body had ever been a&nbsp;factor in&nbsp;her success.</p><p><h2>However, Amy’s feelings during her pregnancy weren’t always so&nbsp;positive.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f1b/c85/24aff7552f89ab89f75f50e34c.jpg><p>After learning she was pregnant, the actress couldn’t help but go&nbsp;back to&nbsp;her final scenes in&nbsp;<i>Junebug</i>, where her character delivers a&nbsp;stillborn baby. “Because of&nbsp;how that film ended, many women have talked to&nbsp;me&nbsp;about their own similar experiences and how much that character touched them,” she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>shared</a>. “Having played someone who went through that, I&nbsp;was terrified.”</p><h2>But her husband was always <a href=#>there</a> for her.</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/890/2cc/e24e4e5569b40e174c4fc7e9cd.jpg><p>Adams eventually had a&nbsp;natural, drug-free delivery after her efforts in&nbsp;researching her baby girl’s arrival and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>attending</a> birthing classes with her husband, Darren Le&nbsp;Gallo. “[Darren] was really calm,” she reveals, adding that the couple has learned to&nbsp;work together. “Now we&nbsp;understand the importance of&nbsp;teamwork.

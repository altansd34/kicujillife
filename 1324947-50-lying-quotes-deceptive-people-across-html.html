Rowling</i></li><li>At times to be silent is to lie. You will win because you have enough brute force. But you will not convince. To convince you to need to persuade. And in order to persuade you would need what you lack: Reason and Right. - <i>Miguel de Unamuno</i></li><li>The rules are simple: they lie to us, we know they're lying, they know we know they are lying, but they keep lying to us, and we keep pretending to believe them. - <i>Elena Gorokhova</i></li><li>The slickest way in the world to lie is to tell the right amount of truth at the right time and then shut up. - <i>Robert A.

And given a choice between a terrible truth and a beautiful lie, accept the fact every time. - <i>Mira Grant</i></li><li>There are different ways to be confused about how someone's disappointed you. Some lie about the future because they wanted to forget the past. But some will lie about history because they think it will give you both a future. - <i>Laura Dave</i></li><li>It was hard to live normally when you were continually pretending you didn't see what was going on in front of your face. - <i>Cassandra Clare</i></li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/235ba67697918c2e.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>The best quotes about helping others that will tug at your compassion</span></p></a><h2>Other sayings and quotes about liars</h2><p class=align-left>According to Martin Luther King Junior, a lie cannot live.

In&nbsp;fact, we&nbsp;(especially women) are more like our fathers, and not our mothers. Besides, there is&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a href=#>theory</a> that a&nbsp;father’s <a href=# title=lifestyle data-link=tag>lifestyle</a> before the conception of&nbsp;the baby, including the food he&nbsp;eats and how he&nbsp;feels, are the basis of&nbsp;the future <a href=# title=health data-link=tag>health</a> of&nbsp;the baby. This article will tell you about the traits that are inherited from the father and which are from the mother.</p><p><strong>Bright Side</strong> wants you to&nbsp;remember that even if&nbsp;you have good genes, you should still maintain a&nbsp;healthy lifestyle. Because, in&nbsp;the end, your lifestyle is&nbsp;the key factor to&nbsp;how you will look and feel.</p><p><strong>Most of&nbsp;the time, children inherit the shape of&nbsp;the tip of&nbsp;their nose, the area around their lips, the size of&nbsp;their cheekbones, and the corners of&nbsp;their eyes</strong>. These are the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>key areas</a> highlighted during facial recognition, and people who have similar-looking areas that we&nbsp;mentioned above, will appear almost identical.</p><p>Mother’s genes are <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>usually</a>&nbsp;50% of&nbsp;a&nbsp;child’s <a href=# title=DNA data-link=tag>DNA</a>, and father’s genes are the other 50%. <strong>However, male genes are much more aggressive than female genes, that’s why they are usually more prominent</strong>. So, there are usually&nbsp;40% active female genes and&nbsp;60% active male genes.</p><p>A&nbsp;pregnant woman’s body identifies the fetus as&nbsp;a&nbsp;partially alien body. In&nbsp;order to&nbsp;save the baby, it&nbsp;has to&nbsp;find peace with the aggressive genes from the father (sometimes, at&nbsp;the cost of&nbsp;her own genes). However, it&nbsp;is&nbsp;still possible to&nbsp;figure out which traits a&nbsp;child can inherit from their father and which they get from their mother.</p><p><h2>Sex</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/db6/d8d/fe92355819b872399ce702136f.jpg><p>The sex of&nbsp;the future baby depends on&nbsp;the <a href=#>father</a>. From their mother, a&nbsp;baby always receives the X-chromosome and from father either an&nbsp;X-chromosome (which means it&nbsp;will be&nbsp;a&nbsp;girl) or&nbsp;a&nbsp;Y-chromosome (which means it&nbsp;will be&nbsp;a&nbsp;boy).</p><p><strong>If&nbsp;a&nbsp;man has a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;brothers in&nbsp;his family, he&nbsp;will have more sons and if&nbsp;he&nbsp;has a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;sisters, he&nbsp;will have more daughters</strong>. Only some men have a&nbsp;relatively equal number of&nbsp;X- and Y-chromosomes in&nbsp;their sperm and they are equally likely to&nbsp;have boys or&nbsp;girls.</p><p>Y-chromosomes have <a href=#>fewer</a> genes than X-chromosomes and some of&nbsp;them are responsible for the development of&nbsp;male genitals. This is&nbsp;why a&nbsp;boy is&nbsp;more likely to&nbsp;look like his mother. When it&nbsp;comes to&nbsp;girls, they receive X-chromosomes from both parents, so&nbsp;it’s impossible to&nbsp;predict what they will look like.</p><p><h2>Intelligence</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a89/c00/2472d65915a3f1c640f0ce3574.jpg><p>The genes responsible for <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>intelligence</a> are contained in&nbsp;the X-chromosome. <strong>This is&nbsp;why sons inherit their intelligence from their mothers</strong>. Daughters receive their intelligence from both parents. However, only up&nbsp;to&nbsp;60% of&nbsp;a&nbsp;mother’s intelligence is&nbsp;inherited, the rest is&nbsp;received over the course of&nbsp;their lives&nbsp;— nothing can replace hard work.</p><p><h2>Inclination for mental illness</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a8b/09e/299afe5f61b694e6730cac70e0.jpg><p>With age, the quality of&nbsp;sperm decreases. <strong>This is&nbsp;why elderly men can pass on&nbsp;mutated genes to&nbsp;their children</strong>. This increases the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>risk</a> of&nbsp;developing mental illnesses, autism, hyperactivity, or&nbsp;bipolar disorder. Also, children born to&nbsp;fathers who are over 45&nbsp;years old or&nbsp;more are more likely to&nbsp;have learning difficulties.</p><p>And men who were <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>infertile</a> and the conception was done artificially, often have sons with the same problem.</p><p><h2>Inclination to&nbsp;be&nbsp;overweight</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/1ab/4a8/15a8bc5356b900ccf80fcddffd.jpg><p>The inclination to&nbsp;be&nbsp;overweight or&nbsp;to&nbsp;be&nbsp;fit is&nbsp;inherited genetically. Some people’s weight and waist measurements are based on&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>genes</a> about 25-80% of&nbsp;the time. People who try to&nbsp;combat extra weight often inherit it&nbsp;from their parents. In&nbsp;situations like these, it&nbsp;is&nbsp;really hard to&nbsp;lose the extra pounds. But even in&nbsp;this case, a&nbsp;reasonable diet and physical activity will be&nbsp;beneficial.</p><p>The inclination to&nbsp;be&nbsp;fit or&nbsp;overweight can be&nbsp;equally inherited from either parent, but the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>inclination</a> to&nbsp;be&nbsp;fat is&nbsp;inherited more often than the inclination to&nbsp;be&nbsp;fit.</p><p><strong>The weight of&nbsp;a&nbsp;child depends mostly on&nbsp;their </strong><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>mother</strong></a>. Overweight mothers tend to&nbsp;have overweight and big babies. It&nbsp;doesn’t depend on&nbsp;how much a&nbsp;father weighs, a&nbsp;child will be&nbsp;thin if&nbsp;a&nbsp;mother is&nbsp;thin. And if&nbsp;a&nbsp;mother is&nbsp;overweight, her child may carry extra weight right after birth.</p><p><h2>Eye color</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ed0/332/1450315f2ca5d8eeabbccc421e.jpg><p>Brown eye color is&nbsp;not a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>dominant</a> gene, like we&nbsp;used to&nbsp;think. <strong>Actually, eye color is&nbsp;the result of&nbsp;8&nbsp;different genes</strong>. This explains why sometimes kids born to&nbsp;blue eyed parents can be&nbsp;born with green, hazel, or&nbsp;brown eyes. It&nbsp;just depends on&nbsp;how those genes collaborate.</p><p><h2>Dimples</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d0a/8bd/0a08d957ae81e6c917cb755688.jpg><p>Dimples are a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>dominant trait</a>. <strong>If&nbsp;at&nbsp;least one of&nbsp;the parents has dimples, it’s likely that the child will have them too</strong>.</p><p><h2>Curly hair</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b44/194/926794581b9ac107002f39e23c.jpg><p>Curly hair is&nbsp;really beautiful and many mothers dream of&nbsp;having a&nbsp;child with curly hair. <strong>But, despite the fact that curly hair is&nbsp;a&nbsp;dominant trait, even if&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the parents has&nbsp;it, it&nbsp;doesn’t mean the child will have this hair</strong>.</p><p>The simple <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>system</a> is&nbsp;like this:</p><ul><li>If&nbsp;both parents have curly hair, the child will have curly hair too.</li><li>If&nbsp;both parents have straight hair, the child will have straight hair.</li><li>If&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the parents has curly hair and the other one has straight hair, the child will have wavy hair.</li></ul><p><h2>Bonus: How to&nbsp;predict what your baby will look like</h2></p><p>Look at&nbsp;the family photos of&nbsp;both parents. Pay attention to&nbsp;the traits that are found in&nbsp;most relatives (a&nbsp;crooked nose, curly hair, dark eye color). These traits are dominant and it&nbsp;is&nbsp;highly likely that your future baby will have them too.</p><p>Which of&nbsp;your parents do&nbsp;you take after?

For some, it signifies joy, while for those who seem lonely, it invokes gloom and depression. Whatever definition you read to each time it falls, here are some beautiful <a id=https://www.brainyquote.com/topics/rain-quotes href=# rel="nofollow noopener">quotes about rain</a> that fit into your perspective of the moment.</p><p class=align-left>If you find yourself under a torrential downpour, how do you feel, and what memories does it invoke in you? As much as you want to relate to the feelings of rainy days, we hope you will find these heavy rain quotes captivating enough.</p><ul><li>The rain fluctuates between drizzle and torrential. It messes with your mind. It makes you think things will always be like this, never getting better, always letting you down right when you thought the worst was over. -<i> Susane Colasanti</i></li><li>I have always considered the rain to be healing--a blanket--the comfort of a friend. Without at least some rain in any given day, or at least a cloud or two on the horizon, I feel overwhelmed by the information of sunlight and yearn for the vital, muffling gift of falling water. - <i>Douglas Coupland</i></li><li>Not excepting the falling stars--for they are far less sudden--there is nothing in nature that so outstrips our unready eyes as the familiar rain. The rods that thinly stripe our landscape, long shafts from the clouds, if we had but agility to make the arrowy downward journey with them by the glancing of our eyes, would be infinitely separate, units, an innumerable flight of single things, and the simple movement of intricate points. -<i> Alice Meynell</i></li><li>Rain hangs about the place, like a friendly ghost. if it's not coming down in delicate droplets, then it's in buckets; and if neither, it tends to lurk suspiciously in the atmosphere. - <i>Barbara Acton-Bond</i></li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/1b8d5fbbbe4a6f38.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>The best water quotes that will inspire you to not give up in life</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/3b5ed6bf383575ac.jpg><ul><li>The all-night rain puts out summer like a torch. In the heavy, black rain falling straight from invisible, dark sky to invisible, dark earth the heat of summer is annihilated, the splendour is dead, the summer is gone. The midnight rain buries it away where it has buried all sound but its own. I am alone in the dark still night, and my ear listens to the rain piping in the gutters and roaring softly in the trees of the world. - <i>Edward Thomas</i></li><li>Shortly afterwards it started raining, very innocently at first, but the sky was packed tight with cloud and gradually the drops grew bigger and heavier, until it was autumn's dismal rain that was falling--rain that seemed to fill the entire world with its leaden beat, rain suggestive in its dreariness of everlasting waterfalls between the planets, rain that thatched the heavens with drabness and brooded oppressively over the whole countryside, like a disease. - <i>Halldor Laxness</i></li><li>Rain, midnight rain, nothing but the wild rain on this bleak hut, and solitude, and me remembering again that I shall die and neither hear the rain nor give it thanks for washing me cleaner than I have been since I was born into solitude. -<i> Edward Thomas</i></li><li>Trees bear fruits only to be eaten by others; the fields grow grains, but they are consumed by the world. Cows give milk, but she doesn't drink it herself - that is left to others. Clouds send rain only to quench the parched earth. In such giving, there is little space for selfishness. - <i>Munshi Premchand</i></li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/51ece6961c8b9fd5.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Top disappointment quotes and memes to use when you feel a little blue</span></p></a><h2>6 happy rain quotes</h2><p class=align-left>Why is rain beautiful? Starting from when the cloud forms in preparation for rainfall until after the downpour, each of the processes is significant in human life. The clear sky symbolises the human mind while the cloudy sky tells of the abounding tensions with a human.</p><p class=align-left>Also, the drizzles and eventual downpour tell of how people start to cry, and when the sky clears, it shows how a person's mind becomes clear. These <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">quotes about the shower</a> are perfect in expressing your joyful mood as you reminisce about the lessons of life that every downpour teaches.</p><ul><li>Beloved, let us once more praise the rain. Let us discover some new alphabet, for this, the often praised; and be ourselves. The rain, the chickweed, and the burdock leaf, the green-white privet flower, the spotted stone, and all that welcomes the rain; the sparrow too,— who watches with a hard eye from seclusion beneath the elm-tree bough, till rain is done. - <i>Conrad Potter Aiken</i></li><li>In the truest sense of the word, rain deserves to be called a present from heaven. The blessings which our Heavenly Father pours upon us by this means are equally abundant and necessary for us. As the consequences of a continued draught would be fatal to us, so the advantages are equally precious which the refreshing showers afford. -<i> C. C. Sturm</i></li><li>It’s a relief to hear the rain. It’s the sound of billions of drops, all equal, all equally committed to falling, like a sudden outbreak of democracy. Water, when it hits the ground, instantly becomes a puddle or rivulet or flood. - <i>Alice Oswald</i></li><li>I’m singing in the rain, just singing in the rain; What a wonderful feeling, I’m happy again. - <i>Arthur Freed</i></li><li>Rain is grace; rain is the sky descending to the earth; without rain, there would be no life. - <i>John Updike</i></li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/cd28a2e54dcdf6a1.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>50 lovely flower quotes to brighten up your mood for spring</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/1b8d5fbbbe4a6f38.png><ul><li>Let the rain kiss you.

Chesterton</i></li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/8ba83851edf09dfd_w.png><ul><li>Rain makes me feel less alone.

It makes me feel better to know other things in nature can shatter. - <i>Lone Alaskan Gypsy</i></li><li>I’m continually inspired by nature, and the rainbow is one of nature’s greatest optical phenomenons. The sighting of a rainbow never fails to bring a smile to people’s faces. They signify optimism and positivity: with them comes the sunshine after the rain. - <i>Matthew Williamson</i></li><li>The richness of the rain made me feel safe and protected; I have always considered the rain to be healing—a blanket—the comfort of a friend. Without at least some rain in any given day, or at least a cloud or two on the horizon, I feel overwhelmed by the information of sunlight and yearn for the vital, muffling gift of falling water.<i> - Douglas Coupland</i></li><li>If you truly get in touch with a piece of carrot, you get in touch with the soil, the shower, the sunshine.

The 19-year-old, who publicly came out as a member of the LGBTQIA+ community in January 2021, discussed her struggles with dating and the unique challenges she faces as a celebrity and a former child star.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-jojo-siwa-accidentally-called-her-father-while-doing-it>JoJo Siwa Accidentally Called Her Father While Doing It</h2><p>In the podcast episode, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Siwa</a> shared a hilarious story about accidentally butt-dialing her father while being intimate with someone. Despite the embarrassing mishap, Siwa managed to find humor in the situation and implemented a new rule to keep her phone away during intimate moments.</p><p>“It’s my third night with this partner. It’s really fun, I’m happy, I’m having the time of my life. Cut to the next day, and my dad comes up to me and goes, So you guys had fun last night. Last night you called me,” Siwa said.</p><p>The Nickelodeon alum also discussed the complexities of her <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">love life</a>, acknowledging that it differs from that of most teenagers. Not only does she navigate the challenges of dating as a celebrity, but her upbringing as a child star adds an extra layer of complexity. Siwa admitted feeling “very behind in the world of love,” attributing it to her unconventional lifestyle.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Growing Up Makes Love Complicated For JoJo Siwa</h2><p>Growing up in the spotlight and being homeschooled deprived Siwa of the typical high school experience, leaving her feeling out of sync with her peers. While she cherishes her close-knit living arrangement with her parents, she acknowledged that it contributed to missing out on certain milestones.</p><p>Despite feeling a step behind, Siwa has had her fair share of romantic experiences. She previously dated influencer Katie Mills and TikTok star <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Avery Cyrus</a>. Last month, she addressed some red flags she noticed in her past relationships. Siwa’s willingness to share her experiences and vulnerabilities allows her fans and listeners to connect with her on a deeper level.</p><p>As Siwa continues to go through the complexities of love and relationships in the spotlight, she remains an inspiring figure for many. Her candidness and ability to find humor in embarrassing situations remind us that even celebrities have relatable and awkward moments.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Original_MarcelitoPomoy_Visa-220x147.jpg alt="Marcelito Pomoy Announced VISA Approval, Gears Up for USA Tour" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>Celebrity</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>JoJo Siwa</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57yaihqGWjnsSiec6pnKerXaq9bq3BqKytZZiav26%2FxLFkpaGWmnq0tMCrnKxlmJ65or7IqKysZZKqwbV5w6KYpWWYpL%2Bzu9Fmqq2noq58</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

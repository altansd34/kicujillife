Modern medicine allows women to choose to postpone having babies, but there are benefits and risks that come with getting pregnant in their 20s versus their 30s.
We at Bright Side looked at some studies and broke down the major pros and cons of having babies when you’re in your 20s and 30s, so that you can decide when the best time is for you to become a mother."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

In&nbsp;fact, in&nbsp;2017, almost half of&nbsp;all births in&nbsp;England and Wales were to&nbsp;mothers who were 30&nbsp;years old. Modern medicine allows women to&nbsp;choose to&nbsp;postpone having babies, but there are benefits and risks that come with getting pregnant in&nbsp;their 20s versus their 30s.</p><p>We&nbsp;at&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side</strong> looked at&nbsp;some studies and broke down the major pros and cons of&nbsp;having babies when you’re in&nbsp;your 20s and 30s, so&nbsp;that you can decide when the best time is&nbsp;for you to&nbsp;become a&nbsp;mother.</p><p><h2>Advantages of&nbsp;giving birth in&nbsp;your 20s.</h2></p><p><h2>1. You’re most fertile, hence have the best chance at&nbsp;getting pregnant.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a3d/384/1ae4a354a09e0fe4ead19bf814.jpg><p>At&nbsp;age&nbsp;25, you have <a href=#>a&nbsp;greater odds at&nbsp;conceiving</a> after 3&nbsp;months of&nbsp;trying (about&nbsp;20%) than when you reach&nbsp;35 (it&nbsp;goes down to&nbsp;about 12%). Women are born with all the eggs they’ll ever have, about 1&nbsp;million. <a href=# title=Fertility data-link=tag>Fertility</a> starts to&nbsp;slowly decline around age 32&nbsp;and this decline gets faster after 35. At&nbsp;age&nbsp;37, you’re estimated to&nbsp;have around 25,000 eggs left.</p><p><h2>2. Lower chances of&nbsp;miscarriage and other pregnancy risks.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7e2/119/cb95bd516fb533d294d5c31633.jpg><p>Unlike women age 35&nbsp;and above, younger mothers are less likely to&nbsp;develop <a href=#>diabetes and high blood pressure</a> when they’re pregnant. Without these problems, and thanks to&nbsp;the higher quality of&nbsp;your eggs when you’re in&nbsp;your 20s, you’ll have less of&nbsp;a&nbsp;risk of&nbsp;miscarriage and stillbirth.</p><p><h2>Advantages of&nbsp;giving birth in&nbsp;your 30s</h2></p><p><h2>1. You’re likely to&nbsp;earn more money, so&nbsp;you’ll have more to&nbsp;spend.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/519/4c1/43d67857f5b99f5491730b9e3b.jpg><p>You would only be&nbsp;<a href=#>starting out</a> in&nbsp;your <a href=# title=career data-link=tag>career</a> when you’re in&nbsp;your 20s, so&nbsp;taking care of&nbsp;a&nbsp;baby can be&nbsp;more costly than if&nbsp;you’re more financially stable in&nbsp;your 30s. And according to&nbsp;a&nbsp;Danish <a href=#>study</a>, first-time mothers age 31-34 with a&nbsp;college degree would earn about $5,000 more than the average income over their lifetime. Those who had babies before they were&nbsp;25, on&nbsp;the other hand, would earn about $80,000&nbsp;less.</p><p><h2>2. You’re more likely to&nbsp;have twins (or&nbsp;triplets)</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/1cc/f39/70c1335b05a5738b7c7936907e.jpg><p>Although this can arguably be&nbsp;a&nbsp;downside, having multiple <a href=# title=pregnancies data-link=tag>pregnancies</a> means that you can be&nbsp;a&nbsp;parent to&nbsp;more than one kid when you’re more mature and ready. It’s good news if&nbsp;you want more than one child, but only want them after you reach your 30s. After all, fertility declines by&nbsp;then, but the <a href=#>chance of&nbsp;having twins increases with age</a> because hormonal changes cause the release of&nbsp;multiple eggs at&nbsp;the same time.</p><p><h2>3. You might live longer.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/029/d2d/ad30c35d33b2beabb79795185e.jpg><p>A&nbsp;study <a href=#>found</a> that women who had their last child after the age of&nbsp;33&nbsp;were twice as&nbsp;likely to&nbsp;live past 95&nbsp;compared to&nbsp;women who had their last child earlier. So&nbsp;postponing pregnancy gives you the benefits of&nbsp;not just improving yourself when you are in&nbsp;your 20s and earning more in&nbsp;your lifetime, but also living longer. This means that you’d have more years to&nbsp;see your kids and family grow.</p><p><h2>4. Your baby might be&nbsp;more intelligent and taller.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/1a7/352/671ea25aa6a86288aad6c7a17f.jpg><p>A&nbsp;UK&nbsp;study <a href=#>found</a> that women who have their firstborns between the ages of&nbsp;30-39 are more likely to&nbsp;have smarter children than mothers age 20-29. Another bit of&nbsp;research <a href=#>discovered</a> that older mothers are likely to&nbsp;have taller children too. Since most people value those with higher intellect and stature, it&nbsp;may be&nbsp;worth waiting until you’ve reached 30&nbsp;before giving birth.</p><p><h2>Risks of&nbsp;giving birth in&nbsp;your 20s</h2></p><p><h2>1. It&nbsp;might be&nbsp;more tiring psychologically.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/1af/7ab/7ff73e5ae798226c7c58f0d543.jpg><p>Your 20s are the best years for you to&nbsp;discover yourself and what path you want to&nbsp;take in&nbsp;your life. A&nbsp;<a href=#>baby</a> during these years could force you to&nbsp;take a&nbsp;break in&nbsp;your career or&nbsp;hold you back from getting the promotion you’ve been working hard for. There could also be&nbsp;relationship issues that arise from the shared responsibilities of&nbsp;caring for the baby. Compromise isn’t easy, especially when both are just figuring out your lives.</p><p><h2>2. You might have worse health outcomes later in&nbsp;life.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/825/f70/040f60540bb51a43834531e599.jpg><p>There appears to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;link between the <a href=#>health</a> of&nbsp;a&nbsp;mother and the age she had her first birth. The more a&nbsp;woman delays her first pregnancy, the better her health is&nbsp;predicted to&nbsp;be. The maximum health was predicted for mothers who had their first birth around the age of&nbsp;30. So&nbsp;younger mothers may risk having less than ideal health and may suffer from more aches and pains.</p><p><h2>Risks of&nbsp;giving birth in&nbsp;your 30s</h2></p><p><h2>1. You’re more likely to&nbsp;need a&nbsp;C-section.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/00a/539/90bd635241a0ca6adce35e4582.jpg><p>Since older mothers have a&nbsp;<a href=#>higher risk</a> of&nbsp;pregnancy-related complications, this may make cesarean delivery necessary. For example, having <a href=#>health problems</a> like high blood pressure, mentioned above, may lead to&nbsp;the surgical delivery of&nbsp;the baby. This delivery is&nbsp;common, but it&nbsp;comes with added risks such as&nbsp;longer recovery time compared with natural birth.</p><p><h2>2. There’s a&nbsp;higher chance your babies may have complications.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/feb/30c/ea96115a1c96a8cbc4cc32b1fd.jpg><p>You’re <a href=#>more likely</a> to&nbsp;have a&nbsp;lower birth weight baby and a&nbsp;premature birth. These can be&nbsp;caused by&nbsp;having twins. <a href=#>Premature</a> babies, especially the ones born earliest, often have issues like breathing problems, impaired learning, and hearing problems. There’s also a&nbsp;higher risk of&nbsp;chromosomal abnormalities that can lead to&nbsp;a&nbsp;baby being born with <a href=#>health conditions.</a></p><p><h2>There is&nbsp;no&nbsp;one perfect age to&nbsp;bear a&nbsp;child.</h2></p><p>From these, we&nbsp;can see that there is&nbsp;no&nbsp;one-fits-all answer as&nbsp;to&nbsp;when is&nbsp;the best age for women to&nbsp;give birth. It&nbsp;all depends on&nbsp;each and every woman’s priorities. Perhaps the best age for you to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;mother is&nbsp;whenever you’re ready to&nbsp;face whatever hurdles that come with the pregnancy.</p><p>When did you have your firstborn?

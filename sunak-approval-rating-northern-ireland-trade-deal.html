Closer to home, the prime minister’s approval rating increased 10 percentage points in the West Midlands and Yorkshire, crucial areas that voted Labour for decades before dramatically swinging to the Tories in 2019.&nbsp;</li><li class="list-disc list-outside mb-s last:mb-0">Younger adults are less impressed with the deal than their older cohorts: Sunak’s approval among those ages 18-44 increased just 2 points to 29%, compared with an 8-point bump among those 45 and older.</li><li class="list-disc list-outside mb-s last:mb-0">Adults in Scotland, which has made independence a serious ambition under First Minister Nicola Sturgeon and largely supported “remain" during the Brexit referendum, saw a similarly small but positive shift.&nbsp;</li></ul><h2 class="font-semibold text-headline2 leading-headline2 mb-m"><strong>Closing the deal may help Sunak begin to move past Brexit</strong></h2><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Brexit <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>has been blamed</a> in some quarters of British society for the tenuous economic situation the United Kingdom finds itself in today. Britain is the only G-7 country with an economy <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>still smaller</a> than it was prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, supplies of basic necessities such as <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>fresh vegetables</a> have been severely disrupted and British manufacturers stand to lose out on a windfall of <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>E.U. defense spending</a> related to Ukraine.

Sunak hyped the deal, which grants major concessions to the European Union, by describing his excitement over Northern Ireland’s “unique” position in having access to both European and British markets — exactly what all British voters once enjoyed, his opponents<a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#> quickly pointed out</a>.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">The deal seems to have done much to galvanize faith in Sunak’s leadership among his base at the least, which puts him in a better position to shape policy and messaging leading up to elections that must be held by January 2025. However, polls of a hypothetical matchup still show Labour with <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>a dominant lead</a>, and time is not on Sunak’s side as he attempts to set the Tories back on track.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiooqR7rrvRp6Cnn5Oku7TBy61lnKedZLavv9Oapa1lmaPBpriOrKynmZtirrG80aitmqRdp661tc2gZKenoqm1pr7NZqCrnZyWu6V506uYnZ1dmbKiuA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

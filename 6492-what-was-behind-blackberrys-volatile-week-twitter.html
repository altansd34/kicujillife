On 28 June, the day that it announced its surprise loss, we can see that a much more significant 30.2% of the Twitter population were exposed to a mention of the brand - a significant increase.</p><p>However BlackBerry reached its greatest audience on 26 June when 50.2% of the Twitter population were exposed to a mention of the brand on their private Twitter feeds.</p><p><span>Volume of Tweets</span></p><p>So what was behind these reach figures? By looking at the ‘volume of tweets’ – that is the amount of tweets that were heard about the brand on each of these days – we can see what was responsible for the spikes in activity.</p><p>Although BlackBerry reached the most number of users on 26 June, there was a lower volume of tweets on this day than on the 25 and 28 June.</p><p>Furthermore, while Blackberry only reached 11.5% of the Twitter population on the 25 June, the volume of tweets on this day (142 per 1000 panellists) was almost as high as on 28 June (152 per 1000 panellists) when 30.2% of the population heard about the brand on their private feeds.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmixn6q0sMKNnKZnrZtkvbC4yK2gnKtflr%2B1tcKlnKxnZmmGc3nWoZitZaeWwG6uxKGgp5xdl7mir8qbnKuqqah6t7vLmquipJVixKaxymarsKGkqbKz</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

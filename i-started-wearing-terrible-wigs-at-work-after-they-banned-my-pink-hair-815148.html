Emily Benschoter turned to TikTok to share her journey at her new workplace, but with the twist that she can never show her pink hair while she’s on duty. She only found out the fact after she had already been interviewed and offered the position, a front-of-house role in the hospitality industry, because there was no prior contact with her employers in-person or over video chat during the hiring process."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

She only found out the fact after she had already been <a href=# title=interviewed data-link=tag>interviewed</a> and offered the position, a&nbsp;front-of-house role in&nbsp;the hospitality industry, because there was no&nbsp;prior contact with her employers in-person or&nbsp;over video chat during the hiring process.</p><p>Her manager then suggested she wore a&nbsp;wig and that’s when she decided to&nbsp;pick the funniest ones she could find. Her first TikTok <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>video</a> with the first wig went up&nbsp;on&nbsp;July&nbsp;19, 2023, and it&nbsp;read: “When you have pink hair, but corporate does not approve, so&nbsp;you wear terrible wigs.”</p><p>Since then, people have become invested in&nbsp;her wig choices and her clips have been viewed millions of&nbsp;times. “The worse the wig, the better,” she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>admitted</a> in&nbsp;an&nbsp;interview. “It&nbsp;is&nbsp;a&nbsp;way to&nbsp;open up&nbsp;the conversation with the customers who think it&nbsp;is&nbsp;insane that&nbsp;I have to&nbsp;cover my&nbsp;pink hair.”</p><p>In&nbsp;the same interview, Benschoter also took time to&nbsp;explain why she didn’t just simply dye her hair instead. “Dying my&nbsp;hair for a&nbsp;job&nbsp;I work at&nbsp;for 40&nbsp;hours per week wasn’t an&nbsp;option,” she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>revealed</a>. “I&nbsp;am a&nbsp;self-expressive person and&nbsp;I feel very confident with pink hair, so&nbsp;I came up&nbsp;with a&nbsp;solution to&nbsp;keep the job and my&nbsp;hair.”</p><p>Despite her having fun with the situation, she doesn’t approve of&nbsp;it. “It’s dehumanizing that&nbsp;I can’t be&nbsp;accepted at&nbsp;face value because my&nbsp;hair is&nbsp;a&nbsp;non-traditional color,” she said. “It’s so&nbsp;superficial that my&nbsp;hair color is&nbsp;an&nbsp;obstacle.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLZuv9Oaqa2dlGLEpq3RoqWgZaSav7O1waWcZq%2BZnMBurdNmrqiqm2Kup8DEq2StoJWueqOtzaecnWWdrnqxtc2kZKGZmad6eX2UamtxZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

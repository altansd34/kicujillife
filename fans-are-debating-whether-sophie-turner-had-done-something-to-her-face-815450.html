The couple, who have two kids, dropped a&nbsp;bombshell on&nbsp;everyone with their divorce announcement. Surprisingly, it&nbsp;was Joe who kicked off the legal process.</p><p>It&nbsp;came out that Joe Jonas had filed for divorce, saying that “the marriage between the parties is&nbsp;irretrievably broken.” However, it&nbsp;was decided that “the best interests of&nbsp;the minor children require the parties to&nbsp;have shared parental responsibility.”</p><p>According to&nbsp;one source, Joe and Sophie’s different lifestyles played a&nbsp;role in&nbsp;their decision to&nbsp;divorce. The source mentioned that “Sophie likes to&nbsp;party, while Joe prefers to&nbsp;stay home. Their contrasting ways of&nbsp;life contributed to&nbsp;Joe’s choice to&nbsp;end the marriage.”</p><p><h2>People have been talking and wondering about how Sophie looks different.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/4e1/5f9/3709745990b415481518f05e36.jpg><p>Richard Shotwell/Invision/AP/East News</p><p>Sophie Turner was just a&nbsp;kid when she started on&nbsp;the show and has since grown into an&nbsp;amazing woman and mom. But recently, people on&nbsp;Twitter started talking about her looks.</p><p>Some thought she had plastic surgery, maybe buccal fat removal because her face seemed slimmer. These rumors started in&nbsp;2022 and continued into 2023, with fans sharing their thoughts online. Some said the alleged procedure made her look older, while others preferred her with fuller cheeks.</p><p>On&nbsp;the other hand, some people believed Sophie’s change was just a&nbsp;result of&nbsp;getting older and <a href=# title="losing weight" data-link=tag>losing weight</a>. They thought her face naturally slimmed down, giving her more defined cheekbones. One tweet summed up&nbsp;this <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>viewpoint</a>: “Sophie Turner has always been skinny. When she was introduced to&nbsp;the world, she was a&nbsp;CHILD with baby fat on&nbsp;her cheeks still. Now she’s a&nbsp;woman who has gone through puberty, pregnancy, and all the body changes that go&nbsp;with&nbsp;it. Why would you assume buccal fat removal?”</p><p><h2>She had a&nbsp;tough time accepting her beauty before becoming the strong woman she is&nbsp;today.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/90f/f47/d12e305bcea262d7b936079bc4.jpg><p>Lots of&nbsp;fans adore Sophie for who she&nbsp;is, regardless of&nbsp;any perceived changes. But in&nbsp;the past, Turner admitted she had a&nbsp;tough time dealing with how people online would trash-talk her appearance, especially when she was younger. Comments about her weight and skin really got to&nbsp;her.</p><p>Thus, in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>2022</a>, Turner took a&nbsp;break from Instagram and tried to&nbsp;distance herself from social media. Turns out, it&nbsp;was a&nbsp;good move for her well-being.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/1b8/0cc/03f8de5712bb3208d205664389.jpg><p>But as&nbsp;the years rolled&nbsp;on, Turner started feeling more confident. She got some helpful advice from her older sister-in-law, <a href=# title="Priyanka Chopra" data-link=tag>Priyanka Chopra</a>, who <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>told</a> her that to&nbsp;get the reactions she wanted from people, she had to&nbsp;strut into a&nbsp;room with confidence and act like she owned the place.</p><p>She also gave credit to&nbsp;her now ex-husband, Jonas, for helping her through some really tough times. When they first met, she was mentally struggling, and Jonas laid it&nbsp;out straight—he couldn’t be&nbsp;with her unless she loved herself first. He&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>told</a> her, “I&nbsp;can’t see you love me&nbsp;more than you love yourself.”</p><p>However, in&nbsp;the middle of&nbsp;all this talk, it’s worth remembering the importance of&nbsp;self-love and embracing our natural selves. Whether or&nbsp;not Sophie had any procedures, the most important thing is&nbsp;that she feels good and confident in&nbsp;her own skin. Therefore, Turner is&nbsp;not just a&nbsp;talented actor, but also a&nbsp;role model for staying true to&nbsp;yourself in&nbsp;the face of&nbsp;public opinion.</p><p>Despite all the rumors and speculations, Sophie faced life’s challenges with resilience, much like she did when <a href=#>giving birth</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLOiutJmmKudXZmyo63ToqWgZaedsrW0xKtkrKegnbamedOuqaedomK1orCMnaannV2ovK6x06Ggp59dqbxutMSrZJ%2BZk5p6eX2UbWxpZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

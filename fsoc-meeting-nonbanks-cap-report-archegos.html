It’s a question that regulators will also want to know the answer to, as a powerful group of U.S. financial officials prepare to meet Wednesday.

Archegos, a family office, is run by former hedge fund manager Bill Hwang.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">“The situations are slightly different, but they definitely rhyme,” said Gregg Gelzinis, an economic policy analyst at the Center for American Progress, which has close ties to the Biden administration.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">(The public part of the meeting will include a discussion of climate risk and financial stability.)</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Gelzinis writes in a <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>report</a> released Wednesday that the agencies should pass rules so policymakers can revisit systemically important financial institution designations for nonbank financials, which he argues have taken a lot of the risk that banks used to carry before the 2008 financial crisis and the Dodd-Frank Act. Being deemed systemically important would allow for tougher regulation and stricter supervision from the Federal Reserve.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Sen.

What if next time it’s a big one?”&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiooqR7rrvRp6Cnn5Oku7TBy61lnKedZK6zwMico56rX5vAsK%2BMppyerJmjtG66zqeZmqabqHqkrc9mqZ6on6fBbq3RnJ%2Ben5%2Bo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

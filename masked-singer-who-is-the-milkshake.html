There’s a <a href=#>brand new format</a>, a record 22 contestants, and some of the best costumes we’ve seen to date.

Joining fellow season 8 foodies, Avocado and Maize, will Milkshake have what it takes to win the Golden Mask? From the preview, it looks like they’re having fun! But who is under the mask?

(Kelis, anyone?) Before the season, the only clue we had about Milkshake is from The Masked Singer <a href=#>Instagram</a>. In the post, the mask-ray reveals a can of whipped cream as Milkshake’s first clue.</p><p>On 90’s Night, we got all the <a href=#>clues</a> though! During his walkout, it said he’s “unbreakable.” His clues are in a rap! Milkshake says, “Ready for action so pick up the blitz, ever since I was a kid I was makin’ hits.” One of the men in black holds up a bowl of peach pits. On a newspaper that said “Masked Singer Season 8 pg. 6,” the headline is “MILKSHAKE BREAKS RECORDS!” He mentions dropping a mixtape that was “certified fire.”</p><p>The “biggest name in the game” reached out to Milkshake to collab and “handed [him] the ball cuz [he] never drop[s] it” then “took off like a rocket.” We see a glass of orange juice and an orange being held. We then see Milkshake pointing to an ice cream sundae. He closes by saying “ring a bell cause I’m ready to fight!” Danielle Fishel from Boy Meets World presented his last clue, a CD case that said, “a playlist that’s perfect for your pre-game, main event, and afterparty. Just ask Wiz and Snoop!”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=block-4f352515-790c-422a-a895-5110a1a3c01b>Popular Guesses for&nbsp;The Masked Singer&nbsp;Milkshake</h2><p id=block-adeca979-196e-403e-bb95-1765dad45339>The panelists narrowed it down to either an athlete or a rapper. Robin thought it might be Tyreek Hill, DeSean Jackson, or Ezekiel Elliott. Ken said it could be LL Cool J, but Robin didn’t agree. Jenny predicted maybe DJ Jazzy Jeff. Nicole played off that, throwing out Nas or Ice Cube, but then said TI came up for her.</p><p id=block-fac285df-5750-4f52-a7df-fe7a06b9b7d0><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>‘THE MASKED SINGER’ RETURNS WITH THRILLING FORMAT TWISTS</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=block-eaceb52c-f4c5-482b-8aa5-0e77f63bfe76>Who is the Milkshake on&nbsp;The Masked Singer?</h2><p id=block-4f540236-784e-4f7a-a2cc-07e1b50dc01b>We loved his rap, but at the end of the episode, it was Milkshake getting unmasked, leaving <a href=#>the Lambs</a> to move on to the Semi-finals.

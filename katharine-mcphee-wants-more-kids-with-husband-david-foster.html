McPhee has been enjoying life as a mother after welcoming her first child with Foster in 2021. She recently shared that together with her husband, they want to continue to grow their family.</p><p>“I would love to have another baby, but we’ll see,” McPhee said. “We’re not in any crazy rush, but I hope so.”</p><p>Hudson then asked McPhee if her son is displaying any signs of being a singer “like his mommy.” McPhee answered that while she’s not being critical of her young boy Rennie, who’s barely two years old, she said that singing may not be “his strong suit.”</p><p>For those who may not know, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">McPhee</a> announced her first pregnancy in December 2020 on Instagram. Within the post, she wore a long powder-blue coat and held her baby bump. Given their age difference, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Foster and McPhee</a>‘s announcement that they were having a child together was met with mixed reactions. The songwriter is well aware of the “naysayers” who questioned their choice.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>McPhee Revealed That Foster is Still Getting Used to Caring For a Child During His Later Years</h2><p>Aside from his youngest child Rennie with McPhee, <a href=#>Fo</a><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">s</a><a href=#>ter</a> also has&nbsp;six adult daughters from previous relationships. McPhee revealed that Foster is still adjusting to the thought of becoming a father later in life.</p><p>“At this point in my life, it’s different again. Not better or worse, just different,” Foster said. “I still work, I’m still gone a lot, but maybe the time is a little more precious to me because I got more runway behind me than I have ahead of me now.”</p><p>Despite this, Foster said that having a toddler at 73 demands “patience,” a quality he acknowledges he lacked when he was raising his six daughters. Foster shared that what he can give to his youngest child Rennie, is his wisdom of being on the planet for 73 years.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Original_MeghanTrainorBabyAnnouncement_viaIG-220x147.jpg alt="Meghan Trainor Reveals She’s Pregnant with Her Second Child" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57ypqroZminrumecycp6GdlWLEorrTrGSmp6Kaeqy1w6xksKGknXqpwdKbmKecXZmut7XDZp2oq6Sav3A%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

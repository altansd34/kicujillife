In&nbsp;<a href=#>Iceland</a>, they even had <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>pools</a>. The thing&nbsp;is, there are many geysers on&nbsp;the island, and settlers from Scandinavia learned to&nbsp;use them for their own benefit.</p><p>The famous <a href=# title=Icelandic data-link=tag>Icelandic</a> historian of&nbsp;the 12th century, Snorri Sturluson, built himself a&nbsp;pool with geothermal water from the hot spring of&nbsp;Skrifla. Soon, medieval Icelanders built many more of&nbsp;these pools. Archaeologists have found similar baths in&nbsp;many settlements.</p><p><h2>They could wash themselves in&nbsp;dirty water.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f34/041/8066505a01be971111dce52023.jpg><p>Vikings bathed more frequently than most people living in&nbsp;the Middle Ages. According to&nbsp;numerous <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>sources</a>, they washed every morning, took care of&nbsp;their oral hygiene, and combed their hair. Most likely, they wiped their bodies with a&nbsp;sponge soaked in&nbsp;water from a&nbsp;basin. Serious washing took place on&nbsp;Saturdays. The name of&nbsp;this day of&nbsp;the week is&nbsp;translated from Scandinavian languages as&nbsp;“washing day.”</p><p>However, the quality of&nbsp;the water that the Vikings splashed around in&nbsp;was not always great. According to&nbsp;Ibn Fadlan, an&nbsp;Arab diplomat from the 10th century, all the men would wash themselves with the same water or&nbsp;bathe one after another.</p><p><h2>Staining someone on&nbsp;purpose was a&nbsp;criminal offense.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/2fc/2c0/84316658388526bab5330a7222.jpg><p>For the Vikings, maintaining a&nbsp;neat appearance was a&nbsp;matter of&nbsp;honor, so&nbsp;the intentional dirtying, cutting of&nbsp;hair, or, for example, pushing someone into a&nbsp;puddle was considered a&nbsp;terrible insult.</p><p>The punishment for these actions toward anyone (except enemies, of&nbsp;course) was to&nbsp;be&nbsp;declared an&nbsp;outlaw. In&nbsp;the medieval <a href=#>Icelandic</a> law code <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Grágás</a>, it&nbsp;is&nbsp;stated that the most severe punishment should always be&nbsp;applied to&nbsp;anyone who intentionally disgraced someone by&nbsp;dirtying them.</p><p><h2>They had toilets at&nbsp;home.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/95b/b6d/3663e35a1b88e360ab761ea507.jpg><p>The Vikings did not have modern bathrooms in&nbsp;their homes, as&nbsp;we&nbsp;are accustomed to&nbsp;today. However, in&nbsp;a&nbsp;large house, there was a&nbsp;shared <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>toilet</a> under which channels were laid for the disposal of&nbsp;waste into cesspits.</p><p><h2>And they had something like toilet paper.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/dab/9be/7ce7005251a6f8087d81fc7db0.jpg><p>The Vikings gathered <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>moss</a> in&nbsp;the dense forests surrounding their settlements and used it&nbsp;as&nbsp;<a href=# title="toilet paper" data-link=tag>toilet paper</a>.</p><p><h2>They had health issues due to&nbsp;cattle.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/1ed/8ea/daba285e41bfcd39a573a6e90a.jpg><p>Scientists have found that, despite their love of&nbsp;cleanliness, Vikings had many parasites living in&nbsp;their bodies. The reason for this is&nbsp;that during the cold months, Scandinavians brought their <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>livestock</a> into their homes to&nbsp;keep them from freezing. In&nbsp;other words, their goats and sheep lived with them as&nbsp;if&nbsp;they were cats and dogs.</p><p><h2>Women wore bras.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/cec/b13/ce0f7b55b496a3755ce832d6b4.jpg><p>Archaeologists have found samples of&nbsp;fabric with metal fasteners and circular pieces of&nbsp;metal in&nbsp;Sweden. At&nbsp;first, they thought that women used these discs to&nbsp;protect their shoulders when carrying heavy loads. But soon, they concluded that they were part of&nbsp;the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>bras</a> worn by&nbsp;Viking women.</p><p><h2>Women weren’t allowed to&nbsp;cut their hair.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e38/5a7/a5b76c57de9818a9791339d7fc.jpg><p>A&nbsp;<a href=#>woman</a> with long hair was considered attractive. And this was not just a&nbsp;beauty canon, but a&nbsp;law. The <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Grágás</a> code clearly stated that women were forbidden to&nbsp;cut their hair. This applied to&nbsp;both wives and mothers, as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;female warriors.</p><p><h2>Men would take good care of&nbsp;their beards.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7ae/24e/6dfd8856b580967819708faa2f.jpg><p>In&nbsp;movies and&nbsp;TV shows about Vikings, they are often depicted with long and unkempt beards. But according to&nbsp;historians, most ancient Scandinavians took care of&nbsp;their <a href=#>facial hair</a>. They used combs, razors, and even <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>tweezers</a> for this purpose. In&nbsp;every village, there was an&nbsp;experienced craftsman who made combs.</p><p>Vikings considered a&nbsp;man with a&nbsp;thick and lush beard to&nbsp;be&nbsp;more mature and masculine. There are several medieval writings where Vikings without facial hair were ridiculed.</p><p><h2>Vikings ate with knives and forks.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b3a/60c/6e2bf759748dce48ee073d8297.jpg><p>Vikings did not eat with their hands, as&nbsp;is&nbsp;often depicted in&nbsp;movies&nbsp;— they used <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>spoons</a> and knives. Spoons, like tableware, were made of&nbsp;wood, while knives were made of&nbsp;metal. The ancient Scandinavians always kept these utensils with them. They wore them on&nbsp;a&nbsp;string around their necks or&nbsp;attached them to&nbsp;their belts.</p><p>Movies often take creative liberties and diverge from reality, because a&nbsp;faithful, literal portrayal of&nbsp;the real world may not be&nbsp;as&nbsp;captivating or&nbsp;thrilling for audiences. However, sometimes we&nbsp;can’t help but notice these <a href=#>deviations</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZH5xedSnnLGolZjBprCMn5icrKNirqO71K1kr6GbnruoeceynqKdnpp6tbTArWSmp6aesrR5w6ilrWWklrmsecCbpq6sXW1%2Bc4GRa2Y%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

Despite his divorce from her mom, Antonio loves hanging out with Dakota and making new memories together.

She was <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>married</a> to&nbsp;actor Don Johnson at&nbsp;the time, having been married to&nbsp;him twice before their final separation in&nbsp;1994. Griffith’s first child, Alexander, was with actor Steven Bauer, whom she married in&nbsp;1981 and divorced in&nbsp;1989. She had her daughter Dakota with Johnson, with marriages spanning 1976-1976 and 1989-1996.</p><p>Marrying Griffith, who had two young children, was nerve-wracking for the actor. At&nbsp;35, Antonio Banderas suddenly <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>became</a> the stepfather to&nbsp;6-year-old Dakota and 10-year-old Alexander.</p><p>When asked about becoming a&nbsp;stepfather, Banderas <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>admitted</a> it&nbsp;was challenging. He&nbsp;had to&nbsp;reassure the kids that he&nbsp;was there to&nbsp;stay, and acknowledged that it&nbsp;was difficult because they had to&nbsp;accept him while he&nbsp;was “totally inexperienced.”</p><p>Once he&nbsp;understood his fatherly role, Banderas began slowly building a&nbsp;relationship with his stepchildren, trying to&nbsp;offer them stability and gradually <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>becoming</a> a&nbsp;father figure. The situation became even more challenging when his daughter <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Stella</a> was born, as&nbsp;he&nbsp;was still working on&nbsp;earning Alexander’s and Dakota’s trust and affection. When asked how long it&nbsp;took for the kids to&nbsp;feel at&nbsp;ease, Banderas <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>mentioned</a> that within a&nbsp;year, they realized he&nbsp;was there to&nbsp;stay.</p><p><h2>He&nbsp;greatly influenced his stepdaughter’s career.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/8c6/81f/9d771753c58aaa1e3dd39da3fb.jpg><p>Banderas played a&nbsp;big role in&nbsp;Dakota’s acting career. She got her start in&nbsp;his directorial debut, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Crazy in&nbsp;Alabama</i></a>, in&nbsp;1999, acting alongside her mom. Also, as&nbsp;a&nbsp;kid, Dakota often hung out with Banderas on&nbsp;movie sets.</p><p>For example, when Dakota jumped into her new, challenging role in&nbsp;the action-packed film <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Madame Web</i></a>, she found inspiration from her stepdad Antonio Banderas as&nbsp;he&nbsp;had a&nbsp;big <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>impact</a> on&nbsp;her. “I&nbsp;remember growing up&nbsp;with him, and how he&nbsp;would train for things and get ready for stuff,” Dakota said, adding that she picked up&nbsp;his disciplined approach to&nbsp;fitness and training. “He’s really hard core with that stuff—but I&nbsp;learned a&nbsp;lot from him.”</p><p><h2>Banderas and Dakota’s mother filed for divorce in&nbsp;2014.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d48/e79/ccec4950e8b0139d6238b10d20.jpg><p>Invision/Invision/East News</p><p>Banderas has once revealed Dakota’s sweet nickname for him from her childhood. Dakota <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>called</a> him Paponio, blending “papa” (Spanish for “daddy”) and Antonio, making him her Antonio papa.</p><p>Unfortunately, Banderas and Dakota’s mom filed for divorce in&nbsp;June <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>2014</a> after 18&nbsp;years of&nbsp;marriage. They released a&nbsp;joint statement explaining that they were parting ways in&nbsp;a&nbsp;loving and friendly manner, with mutual honor and respect for each other, their <a href=# title=family data-link=tag>family</a> and friends, and the beautiful time they had spent together. Their separation was amicable, with Griffith citing irreconcilable differences as&nbsp;the reason for their split.</p><p><h2>Dakota and Banderas’ bond has grown stronger with time.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/686/e89/8427835c0690b5b61fd3a07722.jpg><p>Invision/Invision/East News</p><p>Dakota Johnson’s relationship with her stepdad, Antonio Banderas, has only gotten stronger. At&nbsp;the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>2019</a> <a href=# title=Hollywood data-link=tag>Hollywood</a> Film Awards, Dakota gave a&nbsp;heartfelt speech while presenting him with the Best Actor Award, calling him by&nbsp;her childhood nickname (“Papi”) and tearing up&nbsp;as&nbsp;she spoke. She shared how lucky she felt to&nbsp;have gained a&nbsp;bonus dad, who turned out to&nbsp;be&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the most influential people in&nbsp;her life.</p><p>Growing up, Dakota saw Banderas light up&nbsp;their lives, bringing “a&nbsp;remarkably magical little sister” into their <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>family</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/bdd/eca/e56470578385010843e304a8c3.jpg><p>In&nbsp;his acceptance speech, Banderas dedicated the award to&nbsp;Dakota, cherishing the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>nickname</a> “Papi” she gave him. After the event, he&nbsp;told that Dakota’s speech was a&nbsp;complete surprise, as&nbsp;she hadn’t shared it&nbsp;with him beforehand. The speech brought back a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>flood</a> of&nbsp;memories, confirming that their time together was all about family and totally worth&nbsp;it.</p><p>Years have passed since that speech, but nothing has changed between the two. They still love spending time together. Just recently, Antonio Banderas <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>shared</a> a&nbsp;photo with Dakota from one of&nbsp;their hangouts in&nbsp;Malaga, captioning&nbsp;it, “Happiness: Dakota in&nbsp;Malaga!” Another picture shows them posing with friends, highlighting their close and loving relationship.</p><p>Here’s why Antonio Banderas has divorced from Melanie, the real <a href=#>reason</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZMSpxYydmKSnpJZ6q7vHp6qopl2Yrq240maqrZ2gm661tMSrZJqmpKS7qruMm5innJWnrrR5z5qnomWYmr%2Bmv4ytn55lmJqus8DWmqmmoZ6cerTAzquwZnBhboN2go4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

The Emmy-winning actor, known for his impeccable singing and theatrical talent, declared gospel to be his “wheelhouse” before performing this memorable rendition.</p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Clarkson</a> was quick to acknowledge Porter’s show-stopping cover, calling it the “greatest cover” of any of her songs that she had ever heard. In fact, she mentioned that it was her “favorite cover, literally, of any song [she’s] ever performed.”</p><p>With such high praise from the original artist herself, it was only natural that a collaboration between the two was on the horizon. Clarkson then extended a personal invitation to Porter during the show.</p><p>“Billy Porter, I’m just saying—there’s a personal invite from me anytime you want to sing that song like that with me,” Clarkson said. “If I ever do a show, I’m gonna need a duet. Or I’ll stand on the side of the stage and let you have it. It’s incredible.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWTR5a75NYY</p></figure><p>Porter humbly accepted the invitation, leading to the magical duet that took place in October. The performance left audiences captivated as the two vocal powerhouses lent their unique styles and remarkable talents to “Stronger.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-porter-details-the-time-he-lost-his-voice>Porter Details The Time He Lost His Voice</h2><p>In the interview with Clarkson, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Porter</a> delved into various aspects of his life, from his sense of fashion to his unique voice and his forthcoming album, Black Mona Lisa.</p><p>Porter revealed that his distinctive voice didn’t always sound the way it does today. In his younger years, he had a pristine and high voice, similar to a “choir boy,” which he described as a high-belting soprano.</p><p>However, in 2001, he experienced severe acid reflux, which caused his voice to disappear for about four years. This challenging period then led to the emergence of his current, raspy voice. He also attributes his raspy voice to his journey and newfound authenticity.</p><p>As Porter continues to use his art as a platform for healing and advocacy, his new album, Black Mona Lisa, will showcase his unwavering commitment to authenticity and self-love. Set for release on November 17, 2023, the album is comprised of songs that tell Porter’s story authentically, with depth and nuance.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Original_ArtemChigvinstev_CharityLawson_Disney_Eric-McCandless-220x147.jpg alt="The Hidden Detail You Probably Missed At The End of ‘DWTS’s Disney100 Night" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57yp6jpbFdmLmivsqspqdlkp65rcWMqaarrJWneqS%2BxJqrnmWknbJus9GemK2do6l6t7HRrKCopl2ks26%2F06ump5%2BVp3q4tMCtZJ2nlai7tXnKoqOlZamkwm67zWainqScrryssY4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

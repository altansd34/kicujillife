The two were first spotted together in&nbsp;early 2017, which is&nbsp;when Sophie got pregnant with their future child. In&nbsp;that time, she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>claimed</a> that Drake was questioning his paternity, which was also confirmed by&nbsp;his representative: “If&nbsp;it&nbsp;is&nbsp;in&nbsp;fact Drake’s child, which he&nbsp;does not believe, he&nbsp;would do&nbsp;the right thing by&nbsp;the child.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/9d2/06d/8e45885a66a5b8b2752f107069.jpg><p>Adonis was <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>born</a> in&nbsp;October 2017. The status of&nbsp;Drake’s involvement was a&nbsp;big question until the release of&nbsp;his album <i>Scorpion </i>in&nbsp;June 2018. The rapper confirmed his fatherhood in&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the songs and implied that he&nbsp;wants complete privacy for his child. From then&nbsp;on, Drake and Sophie were never again involved romantically, but they do&nbsp;co-parent Adonis.</p><p><h2>The rapper is&nbsp;now more than hands-on dad.</h2></p><p>Even though Drake was reluctant to&nbsp;put on&nbsp;his “dad” hat at&nbsp;first, he&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>admitted</a> in&nbsp;2018 that he&nbsp;was “really excited to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;great father.” It’s safe to&nbsp;say that the acclaimed musician is&nbsp;still keeping true to&nbsp;his word. In&nbsp;fact, Drake is&nbsp;confident in&nbsp;his parenting skills that he&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>dubbed</a> himself a&nbsp;“co-parent of&nbsp;the year” on&nbsp;his 2021&nbsp;album.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/fe7/960/f3a9b35714a9fcef481997baf4.jpg><p>Drake and Sophie <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>agreed</a> to&nbsp;keep Adonis’ life private until 2020, when both started sharing his first pics online. Since then, the singer and his son are practically inseparable. They are often seen attending public events together and enjoying basketball games courtside. Drake also likes twinning with his mini-me son and sometimes even braids Adonis’ hair to&nbsp;match his.</p><p><h2>His son is&nbsp;his biggest little fan.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/4b8/5e1/2caece5956954663d13c01acc6.jpg><p>Today, Adonis is&nbsp;6&nbsp;years old and Drake is&nbsp;starting to&nbsp;involve him in&nbsp;his career as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;his personal life. In&nbsp;October 2023, the singer released a&nbsp;music video titled <i>8am in&nbsp;Charlotte</i> that extensively <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>features</a> his son. Adonis has made a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>cameo</a> during Drake’s <a href=# title=interview data-link=tag>interview</a> with <i>Barstool Sports</i> and had no&nbsp;issue stealing the spotlight from the world star.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/780/73a/8ba4305bcb9f500d67e7c746cb.jpg><p>The interviewer was joking around with Adonis and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>asked</a> him: “Do&nbsp;you think if&nbsp;you had a&nbsp;better dad you’d be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;read?” The boy showed his sharp sense of&nbsp;humor by&nbsp;replying: “This is&nbsp;my&nbsp;better dad.” He&nbsp;also added that Drake jokes around a&nbsp;lot and is&nbsp;definitely the “funny dad.” Drake then shared a&nbsp;bit more about their lovely relationship: “He&nbsp;definitely just always is&nbsp;vibing out with me&nbsp;and telling me&nbsp;how great I&nbsp;am as&nbsp;a&nbsp;father, like, a&nbsp;single father.”</p><p><h2>Adonis is&nbsp;following in&nbsp;his dad’s footsteps.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/56f/58c/f234565594b7c48f5e37eda29b.jpg><p>The biggest proof of&nbsp;how much Adonis admired his dad is&nbsp;that he&nbsp;is&nbsp;starting to&nbsp;take after him big time. The little guy already <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>made</a> his first rap freestyle called <i>My&nbsp;Man Freestyle</i>, which Drake proudly shared on&nbsp;his Instagram. Considering Adonis already made his rap video debut for his dad’s song and recorded his own little hit, we&nbsp;can definitely expect more from him in&nbsp;the future.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/860/bfa/68c54d5de4b93ab999c16dca1e.jpg><p>Adonis also shows his creative side through <a href=# title=painting data-link=tag>painting</a>. Both Sophie and Drake <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>share</a> his art on&nbsp;their social media, so&nbsp;it’s safe to&nbsp;say he’s taking the best from his dad and his mom. And while we’re watching Adonis’ creative chops develop, we&nbsp;have many more famous children who took after their parents to&nbsp;admire.

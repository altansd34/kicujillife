Just the other day, while Harper was on&nbsp;a&nbsp;family vacation, she rocked a&nbsp;$2,807 handbag like it&nbsp;was no&nbsp;big deal. Of&nbsp;course, this set off a&nbsp;really heated debate on&nbsp;the internet.</p><p><h2>She is&nbsp;the princess of&nbsp;the house.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/1c2/a65/d51711592dba7cb72da199164e.jpg><p>David and <a href=# title="Victoria Beckham" data-link=tag>Victoria Beckham</a> have carved out successful careers in&nbsp;distinct fields. David gained fame in&nbsp;football, while Victoria was a&nbsp;renowned musician before transitioning into a&nbsp;thriving business mogul.</p><p>Coming together as&nbsp;a&nbsp;power couple, the British football legend and his former Spice Girls wife embraced parenthood and were blessed with four wonderful children. Their family includes three sons: Brooklyn, Romeo, and Cruz, alongside a&nbsp;daughter named Harper.</p><p>Among their four kids, the youngest, Harper, holds a&nbsp;special place as&nbsp;the cherished princess of&nbsp;the house. With her striking resemblance to&nbsp;her mother, Victoria, Harper’s fashion style mirrors that of&nbsp;her stylish mom, and there’s a&nbsp;strong likelihood she might follow in&nbsp;her footsteps.</p><p><h2>She’s emulating her mother’s sense of&nbsp;style.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/32d/ff6/d113c1593daa3a9a6db3983daf.jpg><p>Harper is&nbsp;taking after her mom when it&nbsp;comes to&nbsp;fashion. She’s picking up&nbsp;her mom’s sense of&nbsp;style and recently showed it&nbsp;off while they were on&nbsp;a&nbsp;family vacation in&nbsp;Miami. The girl sported a&nbsp;plain white dress, brown sandals, and a&nbsp;fancy <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>$2,807</a> Goyard handbag. The cool thing about Goyard is&nbsp;that it’s super popular among rich and famous people since it’s so&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>exclusive</a>. You can only buy their stuff in&nbsp;their own store.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b94/833/1427e75a619390e58330243720.jpg><p>It’s kinda cool how Harper’s taking cues from her mom’s fashion game and mixing it&nbsp;up&nbsp;with her style as&nbsp;she grows&nbsp;up. However, online users don’t share the same thought, as&nbsp;all eyes were on&nbsp;Harper and her fancy handbag at&nbsp;just 12&nbsp;years old.</p><p>“Just a&nbsp;little very spoiled girl,” some commented, or&nbsp;others <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>wrote</a>, “That’s sad because it’s not teaching her the value of&nbsp;money.” People couldn’t wrap their heads around why a&nbsp;12-year-old would even need something so&nbsp;pricey. But, opinions among fans were divided about Harper rocking that bag, while others were genuinely happy for the Beckham family.</p><p><h2>David can’t turn her little daughter down.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f22/d40/f17a9b5198bf4b2655c4936dcd.jpg><p><a href=# title="David Beckham" data-link=tag>David Beckham</a> always made it&nbsp;clear that he&nbsp;didn’t want to&nbsp;spoil his kids. As&nbsp;Victoria <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>expressed</a>, “David and&nbsp;I explain to&nbsp;the children what privileged lives they lead. We&nbsp;tell them that in&nbsp;many places worldwide, children are hungry, homeless, and sick.”</p><p>But it&nbsp;seems that David had found himself unable to&nbsp;say “no” to&nbsp;his daughter. There was this one <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>time </a>when David said “no” to&nbsp;Harper, but when he&nbsp;saw her looking all sad and upset, he&nbsp;knew he&nbsp;wouldn’t be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;do&nbsp;it&nbsp;again. He&nbsp;realized that Harper really enjoyed hanging out with her mom but was a&nbsp;daddy’s girl. It’s really sweet to&nbsp;see the strong bond between David and Harper.</p><p>The Beckhams are undoubtedly a&nbsp;fantastic family, but they often find themselves caught up&nbsp;in&nbsp;a&nbsp;fair share of&nbsp;controversies, like when David was seen kissing his daughter on&nbsp;the <a href=#>lips</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLe2v9NmmGakmanBrbGMrKeooZyasW6zyKujZpyRq7alecGemqSgkaJ6p63CnqpmmpGYuK2t0qFkn6eiYrSmwNOipaBlmJ7AbrDArp6hrJWneqJ5kXFnaWWSlrRuxcStZKGdXZiur8CMrJiyZZ6kerW7jKGcq2VoZoF3hZBo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

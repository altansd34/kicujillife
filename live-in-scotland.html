The great news is that there are so many different types of home to choose from. Whether you want the charm of an old-school tenement building, the quirky conversion of an old industrial space or the latest modern, luxury apartments, <a href=#>Scotland's cities</a> have something for everyone.&nbsp;</p><h3>Rural life</h3><p>If you prefer the peace and serenity of a rural home, then there are lots of great options for you. You'll also find that the further you move from the town centre, the larger the housing gets. However, thanks to our first-class transport links it's easier than ever to commute to and from the city for work or leisure, truly giving you the best of both worlds.</p><h3>Renting a property</h3><p>If you don’t want to buy a property straight away, renting in Scotland is relatively straightforward and cost effective. We offer excellent tenancy rights to make sure that you're safe, your deposit is treated fairly and the property is looked after. You can rent a property through a housing association, a private landlord or a letting agency and there are usually lots of flat shares available in Scotland’s major cities.</p><h3>Buying a property</h3><p>If you're interested in buying a property in Scotland then the great news is that house prices here are, on average, lower than anywhere else in the UK! In recent times house prices in Scotland have also dropped, making it a buyer's market. In Scotland most properties are sold through estate agents or solicitors (lawyers). However, you can also buy privately through the owner of the property, though you will still need a solicitor to handle the legal work.</p><h3>Council tax</h3><p>If you live in Scotland you will have to pay council tax&nbsp;on your home.&nbsp;Council tax is payable to your local council and the money collected from council tax payments helps to pay for local services such as rubbish and recycling collection and local area maintenance.</p><p><a aria-label="Open link to external website" class="link link--external" href=#>Find out more about council tax at mygov.scot</a></p><h3>Student accommodation</h3><p>Campus accommodation is usually located in the university halls of residence – where students live during term-time. Halls of residence are usually made up of a block of self-catering flats with a number of en suite bedrooms in each. With most campus accommodation, there’s usually a choice of B&B, half-board or self-catering accommodation. You can, of course, live off-campus if you are looking for more independence. Your university of choice will be able to offer advice. Find out more about your <a href=#>university's accommodation</a> options.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FOraOappRjvLOzjqWgr51dnrtuv8Koq6WZnpl8sb7OqZyrrKk%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

First of&nbsp;all, movies are meant to&nbsp;entertain viewers, and only after that do&nbsp;they show&nbsp;us how the world works. But if&nbsp;such ideas go&nbsp;from one movie to&nbsp;another, we&nbsp;start to&nbsp;perceive them as&nbsp;proven facts.</p><p>We&nbsp;at&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side </strong>carefully studied the reviews of&nbsp;scientists and experts who check famous flicks in&nbsp;detail, and we’ve collected a&nbsp;list of&nbsp;movie twists that are complete nonsense in&nbsp;terms of&nbsp;<a href=# title=science data-link=tag>science</a>.</p><p><h2>Objects move in&nbsp;orbit at&nbsp;completely different speeds.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/568/9c1/5405aa5080b2c6f220340f8214.jpg><p><a href=# title="Sandra Bullock" data-link=tag>Sandra Bullock</a>’s character in&nbsp;<i><a href=# title=Gravity data-link=tag>Gravity</a> </i>didn’t have to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>pass</a> the entire way alone&nbsp;— at&nbsp;least from the perspective of&nbsp;physics. The demise of&nbsp;<a href=# title="George Clooney" data-link=tag>George Clooney</a>’s character caused many questions among scientists. During the tragic scene, the movement of&nbsp;both characters in&nbsp;outer space slowed down, which means that Clooney was unable to&nbsp;drag Bullock with him into space. All the actress had to&nbsp;do&nbsp;was lightly tighten the cable and not let the astronaut unhook himself.</p><p><h2>Earthquakes create cracks that “eat&nbsp;up” buildings and cars.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/4e7/546/7c7f105c5ebead7fc90d2c6603.jpg><p>This is&nbsp;a&nbsp;scary but familiar trope in&nbsp;many movies about catastrophes. A&nbsp;city is&nbsp;affected by&nbsp;a&nbsp;huge earthquake, which creates big cracks that literally “eat&nbsp;up” everything&nbsp;— buildings, cars, and pedestrians.</p><p>This seismic phenomenon <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>can</a> indeed cause cracks to&nbsp;appear, but they rarely reach more than 3-6 feet in&nbsp;width. And still, they are quite rare. To&nbsp;date, there is&nbsp;only one <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>known</a> victim of&nbsp;such an&nbsp;event, a&nbsp;poor cow that fell into a&nbsp;crack in&nbsp;1906.</p><p><h2>A&nbsp;phone call can’t be&nbsp;tracked.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b23/00d/9506dc5c03b4abff994edff6b3.jpg><p>We’ve all seen scenes when a&nbsp;villain calls the police and giggles during the call, counting precious seconds and hanging up&nbsp;at&nbsp;the very last moment. In&nbsp;the film, it’s impossible to&nbsp;track this person’s phone number and location.</p><p>The issue did actually <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>exist</a> in&nbsp;the ’70s of&nbsp;the previous century, but today, as&nbsp;connections have become digital, all data can be&nbsp;attained instantly. The idea that it&nbsp;takes time to&nbsp;trace a&nbsp;call is&nbsp;a&nbsp;myth.</p><p><h2>There are secret pathways in&nbsp;planes.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c0f/2d4/04e6fc5b8dbe58f2bbc7328554.jpg><p>In&nbsp;<i>Flightplan</i>, Jodie Foster’s character <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>moved</a> along the plane’s various sections, using different corridors and pathways intended for the staff. In&nbsp;reality, aircraft are designed differently&nbsp;— every square inch in&nbsp;the plane is&nbsp;accounted for.</p><p>Some large aircraft do&nbsp;have access to&nbsp;the baggage section, but in&nbsp;order to&nbsp;get there, one will have to&nbsp;move seats and remove the carpet cover. There are no&nbsp;labyrinths on&nbsp;passenger planes.</p><p><h2>All clones look alike.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7b6/873/2b43755bbf9023ad90639167ad.jpg><p>Since any human cloning experiments have been banned for ethical reasons, films that deal with this issue inevitably <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>show</a> the same mistakes. Clones don’t always look alike. Yes, they have the same set of&nbsp;genes, but their surroundings, upbringing, and natural factors are different, which means they will look different.</p><p>One such mistake <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>was made</a> in&nbsp;<i>Gemini Man</i>, where the character of&nbsp;<a href=# title="Will Smith" data-link=tag>Will Smith</a> runs across a&nbsp;young version of&nbsp;himself. In&nbsp;order to&nbsp;understand whether the young man is&nbsp;really his clone, he&nbsp;checks him with a&nbsp;bee sting. However, this type of&nbsp;allergy is&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>considered</a> to&nbsp;be&nbsp;non-hereditary.</p><p><h2>Cars can fly.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/cc7/e1b/8025fc518e87f5058b4e4973d9.jpg><p>Another popular myth is&nbsp;flying cars. In&nbsp;many scenes of&nbsp;action movies, cars miraculously lift up&nbsp;and fly over significant distances and abysses. Unfortunately, it’s impossible in&nbsp;real life.</p><p>One of&nbsp;the most memorable scenes of&nbsp;this type is&nbsp;in&nbsp;the movie, <i>Speed</i>,<i> </i>where a&nbsp;heavy bus <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>jumped over</a> a&nbsp;hole in&nbsp;an&nbsp;unfinished overpass, though it&nbsp;was supposed to&nbsp;fall down by&nbsp;all laws of&nbsp;physics.</p><p><h2>Earth can fully get flooded by&nbsp;water.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/85f/ce3/8b6a9e586f985636b961a541bc.jpg><p>Movies like <i>Waterworld </i>and <i>2012 </i>show&nbsp;us scary scenes when the world gets fully flooded with water after a&nbsp;disaster. It&nbsp;looks very impressive, but, in&nbsp;fact, it’s unlikely to&nbsp;happen. This is&nbsp;because there is&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>not enough</a> water on&nbsp;our planet to&nbsp;cover its entire surface. This means that water won’t ever flood Earth&nbsp;— at&nbsp;least not its entire surface.</p><p><h2>It’s possible to&nbsp;improve the quality of&nbsp;any photo or&nbsp;video to&nbsp;see more of&nbsp;its details.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/32b/83f/e7b5fe59709bc20c90f21655a5.jpg><p>This myth appeared thanks to&nbsp;the movie, <i>Blade Runner</i>, in&nbsp;which the main character is&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>asked</a> to&nbsp;zoom in&nbsp;on&nbsp;an&nbsp;image to&nbsp;see unnoticeable details. Alas, even modern technology can’t add missing pixels and turn a&nbsp;blurred photo into a&nbsp;clear one. That’s why most secrets unveiled by&nbsp;this method would remain a&nbsp;mystery to&nbsp;people in&nbsp;the real world.</p><p><h2>It’s easy to&nbsp;start a&nbsp;car with the help of&nbsp;ignition wires.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/913/358/d34ec85bfcba12dfdcddd7c403.jpg><p>In&nbsp;movies, the protagonist often gets into a&nbsp;car, masterfully rubs its ignition wires, and starts the vehicle within several seconds. It&nbsp;would be&nbsp;extremely difficult to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>repeat</a> this trick in&nbsp;real life. It’s almost impossible to&nbsp;do&nbsp;it&nbsp;with modern types of&nbsp;cars, while a&nbsp;trial to&nbsp;start an&nbsp;old car with this method can lead to&nbsp;serious engine damage. Based on&nbsp;all this, the idea that a&nbsp;car can be&nbsp;started without a&nbsp;key is&nbsp;a&nbsp;myth.</p><p><h2>Will Smith could rescue everyone.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ff2/33d/ec31a853dbb9ce1c522528f208.jpg><p>A&nbsp;dangerous virus from<i> I&nbsp;Am Legend</i> that was turning all people into monsters would unlikely <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>exist</a> in&nbsp;the real world. The virus in&nbsp;the flick mutated and started to&nbsp;get distributed by&nbsp;air. Scientists say that such behavior is&nbsp;impossible for a&nbsp;virus.</p><p>The second inaccuracy was the fact that Will Smith’s character gave samples of&nbsp;his blood so&nbsp;that scientists could create a&nbsp;vaccine with&nbsp;it. But his character never got the virus, which means he&nbsp;had never been a&nbsp;carrier of&nbsp;the virus. This means it&nbsp;would be&nbsp;impossible to&nbsp;create a&nbsp;vaccine based on&nbsp;his blood.</p><p><h2>Malicious neutrinos could lead to&nbsp;disaster.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7df/175/35680e52d2a14ca5ffb7566d1e.jpg><p>Neutrinos are neutral particles that have an&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>extremely</a> small mass and weakly interact with matter. They are real loners in&nbsp;the world of&nbsp;physics. However, it’s these insidious elements that played a&nbsp;key role in&nbsp;movies such as&nbsp;<i>2012 </i>and<i> Alien: Covenant.</i> In&nbsp;the first case, their emission led to&nbsp;the melting of&nbsp;the Earth’s core and subsequent catastrophes. In&nbsp;the second case, it&nbsp;broke the solar sail of&nbsp;the ship of&nbsp;colonists and forced the astronauts to&nbsp;land on&nbsp;another planet.</p><p>Both the first and the second scenarios are unlikely. Hypothetically, high-energy neutrinos can cause <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>damage</a> to&nbsp;objects, but they are formed when stars explode. If&nbsp;this happened, then it&nbsp;would be&nbsp;the last thing the inhabitants of&nbsp;the earth and the crew of&nbsp;the neutrino ship would worry about.</p><p><h2>Light moves the same in&nbsp;inverted space.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/610/edc/d1920852df8da32bd65dd17a11.jpg><p>Usually, Christopher Nolan treats the laws of&nbsp;physics with respect, but in&nbsp;his last work, the movie <i>Tenet</i>, scientists didn’t see the depth and validity that his other flicks boasted. The very possibility of&nbsp;time invertibility <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>seems</a> very controversial at&nbsp;the moment.</p><p>But even if&nbsp;such technology existed, apart from supplies of&nbsp;oxygen, the characters would require many other things, like light, for example, in&nbsp;an&nbsp;inverted reality. If&nbsp;everything here moves in&nbsp;reverse order, then instead of&nbsp;the regular objects, a&nbsp;person would probably see just a&nbsp;light in&nbsp;front of&nbsp;them.</p><p>What scientific bloopers in&nbsp;modern movies made you laugh?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZH5zec%2Blpq1llJrBorXLrGSfqp%2BieqetzKisrGWdpMOqsdJmq6GZpGKus7GMraatmZxiu7C60p6lrJ1dnrtuwMSrpKxln5t6tK%2FInqWcnV1tfXmDkW9m</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

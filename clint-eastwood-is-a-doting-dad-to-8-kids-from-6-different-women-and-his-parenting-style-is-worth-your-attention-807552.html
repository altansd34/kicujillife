Eastwood’s diverse <a href=# title=romantic data-link=tag>romantic</a> life made him a&nbsp;happy father of&nbsp;8&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>kids</a>. Even after being <a href=# title=divorced data-link=tag>divorced</a> multiple times, he&nbsp;stayed a&nbsp;caring and protective father to&nbsp;his children. However, his personality resembled the tough and firm characters Eastwood often embodied on&nbsp;screen, and his parenting style is&nbsp;based on&nbsp;these specific traits.</p><p><h2>His parenting style was mostly old-fashioned.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f8c/8ea/07e7525dffbac3633ab5ba46a3.jpg><p>Recalling his teenagehood, Scott Eastwood, Clint’s son, speaks of&nbsp;his father as&nbsp;strict and demanding. “If&nbsp;you did something wrong, you were gonna get scolded,” he&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>shared</a>. “I&nbsp;learned quickly&nbsp;— you don’t do&nbsp;that.”</p><p>However, Clint cultivated in&nbsp;his son solid notions and pushed him to&nbsp;be&nbsp;protective of&nbsp;his sisters. “At&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;16, I’d taken my&nbsp;younger sister, who was, like, 14, to&nbsp;a&nbsp;party,” <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>shared</a> Scott. “I&nbsp;left the party and&nbsp;I left her, and&nbsp;I didn’t think about it&nbsp;at&nbsp;the time.” When Clint found out, he&nbsp;got furious. “You don’t ever leave your sister at&nbsp;a&nbsp;party. Ever,” he&nbsp;said.</p><p>“It&nbsp;was very old-school, very old-school of&nbsp;him,” <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>remembers</a> Scott.</p><p><h2>Though, he&nbsp;was not always strict and tough.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/e14/1bd/51c3f55f8b840beef0a2712f48.png><p>However, his strictness did not stop him from being accepting of&nbsp;his children. “Dad didn’t care if&nbsp;I was a&nbsp;plumber or&nbsp;an&nbsp;actor,” <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>shared</a> Scott. “He&nbsp;said, ’Whatever you&nbsp;do, just do&nbsp;it&nbsp;well. Be&nbsp;humble about what you&nbsp;do, be&nbsp;a&nbsp;good guy and tell the truth.’”</p><p>And his sometimes quite conservative behavior goes by&nbsp;the wayside when it&nbsp;comes to&nbsp;messing around and having fun with his children. “My&nbsp;dad is&nbsp;a&nbsp;much more cool and laid-back guy than a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;his characters,” <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a> Alison Eastwood, the daughter of&nbsp;Clint. “He&nbsp;has a&nbsp;wonderfully dry, dark sense of&nbsp;humor.”</p><p><h2>He&nbsp;doesn’t let obstacles stop him from caring about his children.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d05/a7b/4e4aeb5029854dbcd17efeb456.jpg><p>Being an&nbsp;older parent might be&nbsp;uncomfortable for some, but it&nbsp;absolutely does not inhibit Eastwood. On&nbsp;the contrary, he&nbsp;feels like he&nbsp;became a&nbsp;better parent with age, spending more time with his children.</p><p>“I’m a&nbsp;much better father now than when&nbsp;I was younger because then&nbsp;I was working all around the world, and&nbsp;I was desperate to&nbsp;find the brass ring, so&nbsp;I worked constantly,” Eastwood <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>shared</a>. “I&nbsp;go to&nbsp;all the softball games and look ridiculous out there because almost everybody’s got a&nbsp;much younger father than&nbsp;me. But it’s fun. I&nbsp;think you appreciate everything a&nbsp;lot more when you get to&nbsp;my&nbsp;age.”</p><p>“I&nbsp;never started out thinking&nbsp;I would have a&nbsp;big family, but now it’s very important to&nbsp;me, and family relationships take precedence over work,” he&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a>.</p><p><h2>Now it’s the grandchildren’s turn.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/2c0/626/944de85d2ea767cbeb6a7e3dcc.png><p>Despite his complicated romantic relationships, Clint always had time for his children. “My&nbsp;parents split up&nbsp;when&nbsp;I was pretty young, but he&nbsp;always made time for&nbsp;us, even when he&nbsp;was working,” Allison <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>shared</a>.</p><p>Now, Clint is&nbsp;happy to&nbsp;spend time and energy on&nbsp;his grandchildren. Eastwood is&nbsp;a&nbsp;grandpa of&nbsp;5, with his youngest grandchild, Titan, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>being</a> 3&nbsp;years old. Clint will definitely use his diverse experience in&nbsp;parenting to&nbsp;contribute to&nbsp;the upbringing of&nbsp;his grandchildren.</p><p>Did you know Clint Eastwood had such a&nbsp;big family? What do&nbsp;you think about his parenting style?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLCttc2tZJ6Zo6nEsLvDZqCsZZFisbDAyKeeZpyRmXq1u4xxZKShlKh6p77OpmRvZZSes6ex0Z6lrWWnpLqmuoyapZ1lmJ7AbrzAq5ynrJmjtG6%2F07KjnmWZqHq4u9Gtn2axn6q%2Fbq3TrZynrJmku26Ej3Bsbmpf</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

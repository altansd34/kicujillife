Gale also posted a cryptic message on her Instagram stories, writing, “The silence is loud enough for me.”</p><p>On Friday, the couple both posted to their individual accounts sharing the news that they had decided to separate. As they wrote, “Our number one priority is and always will be ensuring that our children are healthy, happy and loved, and we remain committed to co-parenting with love and respect for one another.”</p><p>The couple already has two daughters together — 3-year-old Naomi Bettie and 1-year-old Zara James. Allen also has an 8-year-old son named Aadyn from a previous relationship. Last year, Allen said in an <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">interview with ET</a> that he was “done” having kids. He later added that it was his wife’s idea to stop.</p><p>“But I’m cool if she’s done,” Allen said on the People Every Day podcast. “My jerseys are retired, but then we did talk about maybe in a couple years having another one, but we’ll kind of just see. Whatever happens, happens.”</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO:</strong> <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">JIMMIE ALLEN SAYS GOODBYE TO NASHVILLE, PROMISES HE’S ‘NEVER LEAVING COUNTRY MUSIC’</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-couple-got-married-in-2020>The Couple Got Married in 2020</h2><p>According to People, Allen and Gale first met through Allen’s cousin in 2019, when Gale was finishing up nursing school.

I never wanted to get married. The whole husband thing was not something I ever wanted to do. But Alexis changed that. Now, I like it. It gives me some security — she can’t just be like, ‘I’m done.’ Divorce is a lot of paperwork!”</p><p>Since announcing the split last week, Allen has been promoting his new single “Be Alright.” On Wednesday, he posted a behind-the-scenes feature about the making of the song’s music video.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Original_ColinStough_ABC_Eric-McCandless-220x147.jpg alt="Meet “The Brad Pitt of Country Music,” ‘American Idol’s Colin Stough" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>jimmie allen</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57yaKkpqGVYq6tuMSnqmavmZuybsHNn6alpJ%2BswG60yKZkqKZdnru0wMCgqZqlXZa6qrCMp5ywq12ks27Ax56gq2WjpbmqwI4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

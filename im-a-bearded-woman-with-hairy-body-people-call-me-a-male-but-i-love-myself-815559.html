She paid attention to&nbsp;the hair growth on&nbsp;her face, chest, back, arms and legs. She’s now&nbsp;42, and she reveals that she has never viewed it&nbsp;as&nbsp;a&nbsp;problem. She was growing up&nbsp;in&nbsp;a&nbsp;family where other women were also hairier than usual. But recently, the woman became curious if&nbsp;that was a&nbsp;serious medical issue, so&nbsp;she went to&nbsp;see a&nbsp;<a href=# title=doctor data-link=tag>doctor</a>.</p><p>Khosi <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>says</a>, “I&nbsp;grew up&nbsp;accustomed to&nbsp;hairy women like my&nbsp;aunts being seen as&nbsp;blessed, strong and strict so&nbsp;I figured it&nbsp;was something&nbsp;I had inherited.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/fe2/499/4132fa5a0f994a3195397b92db.jpg><p><h2>Even the doctors were at&nbsp;a&nbsp;loss while commenting on&nbsp;Khosi’s condition.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/bb3/f95/8051dc53068fb46a7dd46ade66.jpg><p>The woman never <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>felt</a> the urge to&nbsp;consult a&nbsp;doctor about her body hair, because she experienced no&nbsp;physical issues. But then she finally visited her&nbsp;GP, and the doctor immediately suggested her to&nbsp;be&nbsp;tested for fertility and PCOS.</p><p>But, to&nbsp;the doctor’s surprise, Khosi didn’t have any issues with her health. The woman recalls, “However, they both came back negative. I&nbsp;could have children if&nbsp;I wanted to&nbsp;and there was no&nbsp;need for hormonal treatment, it&nbsp;all seemed fine.”</p><p>The doctor told Khosi that she had hirsutism, a&nbsp;condition that causes excess hair to&nbsp;grow on&nbsp;certain parts of&nbsp;the body, mostly affecting women.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/530/7da/b9b35e558280d60ed0cbc07468.jpg><p><h2>At&nbsp;first, Khosi thought that hair removing was an&nbsp;option.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/779/903/4aa2b550b499c3916865697ad6.png><p>Self-acceptance didn’t come to&nbsp;Khosi instantly. She <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>started</a> fighting with her own natural appearance and wanted to&nbsp;adjust to&nbsp;some beauty standards. The woman tried a&nbsp;plenty of&nbsp;hair removal procedures, because even her job required her to&nbsp;look “presentable”. But none of&nbsp;the techniques she tried, actually worked.</p><p>She says, “The more&nbsp;I shaved&nbsp;it, the more it&nbsp;grew. I&nbsp;tried waxing, but it&nbsp;proved to&nbsp;be&nbsp;both costly and painful.” The woman then decided to&nbsp;try laser hair removal, but her excessive hair soon came back with double force. She recalls, “After 10&nbsp;sessions, the hair became finer and skin was smooth. I&nbsp;was convinced it&nbsp;worked. However, when&nbsp;I stopped for a&nbsp;year the hair started growing back, and&nbsp;I had to&nbsp;go&nbsp;back to&nbsp;razor shaving.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a0b/22d/ad522f55c68c55071d3b893043.jpg><p><h2>Self-love turned out to&nbsp;be&nbsp;the only option for a&nbsp;happy life for Khosi.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/cc9/5dd/380e645d6f810259143c1edbf2.jpg><p>Khosi suddenly <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>stopped</a> fighting against her facial hair. Instead, the woman decided to&nbsp;embrace it&nbsp;and to&nbsp;love&nbsp;it. She says, “I&nbsp;stopped shaving and instead, started to&nbsp;love myself. I&nbsp;learned that self-acceptance is&nbsp;a&nbsp;crucial aspect of&nbsp;self-care. It&nbsp;is&nbsp;the foundation for our confidence and self-esteem. I’ve had to&nbsp;remember that beauty comes in&nbsp;all shapes, sizes, and forms, and I&nbsp;am bringing body hair to&nbsp;the beauty equation.”</p><p>However, her journey has never been an&nbsp;easy one, because people started sharing negative comments in&nbsp;public and online. The woman revealed that people often stared at&nbsp;her with “fascination” whenever she went outside, and although she first <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>embraced</a> her looks, she now has to&nbsp;demand the respect she fully deserves.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d13/4d3/5621cf5d429f44c4f937e0236a.jpg><p><h2>The woman has a&nbsp;message to&nbsp;all people who can’t accept her unique looks.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d57/283/17c80b51f89ae437ab1b4cde32.jpg><p>Khosi is&nbsp;only learning to&nbsp;deal with negative <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>attitude</a> both online and in&nbsp;real life. She was called “a&nbsp;male” and people can’t really accept her unique looks. But the brave and self-loving woman decided to&nbsp;express her opinion on&nbsp;the public negativity.</p><p>She <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a>, “People in&nbsp;public have reacted with shock, fascination, disgust and disapproval of&nbsp;my&nbsp;beard, but I&nbsp;am actively working on&nbsp;unlearning the need for external validation. Unfortunately, people can be&nbsp;judgmental and cruel towards someone who looks different in&nbsp;some way, so, it’s important to&nbsp;remember that their opinions and comments do&nbsp;not define my&nbsp;worth.”</p><p>Khosi <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>adds</a>, “Ultimately, it&nbsp;is&nbsp;up&nbsp;to&nbsp;me&nbsp;to&nbsp;decide how&nbsp;I want to&nbsp;present and express myself and whether or&nbsp;not&nbsp;I want to&nbsp;keep the beard. It&nbsp;has become an&nbsp;important part of&nbsp;my&nbsp;identity.”</p><p>And here’s yet another motivational story about a&nbsp;woman who was dubbed “Chewbacca” because of&nbsp;her <a href=#>body hair</a>, and her journey to&nbsp;self-acceptance will hardly leave you indifferent.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLauecBmmZ6ZopmypXnWqKSapl2strW0jKGYoqqpYq%2BwsNhmp56noKGybq%2FApaNmpZVirm65wKWcZpqlqXqqecuorZ5lna7AprjFZm9qbWVqhnA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

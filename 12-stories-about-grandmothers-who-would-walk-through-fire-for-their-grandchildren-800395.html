At Bright Side, we decided to find more stories about grandmothers on the internet. Sometimes they are funny, sometimes — a bit sad.
A friend of mine once told me a real story from his childhood."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

She brought chocolate along with her. I&nbsp;love chocolate. My&nbsp;mom forbade me&nbsp;from eating&nbsp;it. A&nbsp;few days later, my&nbsp;mom left me&nbsp;with my&nbsp;grandma while she and my&nbsp;dad ran some errands. As&nbsp;grandparents&nbsp;do, she always spoiled me&nbsp;and let me&nbsp;have as&nbsp;much chocolate as&nbsp;I&nbsp;wanted. Suddenly, my&nbsp;parents returned. I&nbsp;began to&nbsp;cry, my&nbsp;mouth filled with delicious prohibited chocolate. It&nbsp;was then that my&nbsp;grandma bestowed upon me&nbsp;one of&nbsp;life’s most enduring lessons, she said, “If&nbsp;you put it&nbsp;in&nbsp;your mouth, they can’t take it&nbsp;away from you.” <a href=#>©&nbsp;lauramonster&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></p></li><li>Once, at&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;about 7, I&nbsp;lied noisily tossing and turning on&nbsp;a&nbsp;cot in&nbsp;my&nbsp;Nana’s bedroom. The adults had tried frustratingly for hours to&nbsp;help me&nbsp;get to&nbsp;sleep, but&nbsp;I was still unable&nbsp;to. Suddenly Nana crept in&nbsp;wearing her little-old-lady nightie, whispered sympathetically that she couldn’t sleep either, and lied down beside me&nbsp;on&nbsp;the ground before saying very quietly, “Let’s have a&nbsp;race to&nbsp;see who can fall asleep first!” I&nbsp;won. <a href=#>©&nbsp;TheBlackWomb&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li><li>Grandmother says to&nbsp;her daughter (my&nbsp;mother):</li></ul><p>—&nbsp;You can’t sit on&nbsp;a&nbsp;bed. A&nbsp;bed is&nbsp;for sleeping. You can sit on&nbsp;a&nbsp;chair.</p><p>Grandmother says to&nbsp;me (her granddaughter):</p><p>—&nbsp;You can sit on&nbsp;a&nbsp;bed but you can’t jump on&nbsp;it. It’s not a&nbsp;trampoline.</p><p>Grandmother says to&nbsp;my&nbsp;children (her great-grandchildren):<br>—&nbsp;Jump, sweeties, jump as&nbsp;much as&nbsp;you want.

When I&nbsp;asked her why, she replied that once, my&nbsp;grandfather came home and said that he&nbsp;had been promoted. She laid the table and they celebrated this moment. The next day she realized that his life had changed&nbsp;— he&nbsp;had new tasks and new responsibilities&nbsp;— while her life had stayed the same. That was why my&nbsp;grandmother reckoned that&nbsp;I had time to&nbsp;get married and learn how to&nbsp;cook, while studying was much more important. <a href=#>©&nbsp;Laavi T&nbsp;/ Quora</a></li><li>Sometimes I&nbsp;think of&nbsp;how my&nbsp;granny can butter rock-hard Kerrygold into cloud-soft bread without making so&nbsp;much as&nbsp;a&nbsp;dent, and&nbsp;I understand why she’s so&nbsp;disappointed in&nbsp;“people today.” <a href=#>©&nbsp;eithneshortall&nbsp;/ Twitter</a></li><li>I&nbsp;told my&nbsp;granny I’d get her fish and chips on&nbsp;Tuesday and forgot. My&nbsp;granny can’t remember who I&nbsp;am most days, so&nbsp;she’d hardly remember the fish and chips. I&nbsp;called her to&nbsp;tell her&nbsp;I was coming. She says, “I’m still waiting on&nbsp;those fish and chips you promised.” Makes you think, doesn’t it? <a href=#>©&nbsp;JoeMcdo05986552&nbsp;/ Twitter</a></li><li>Since I&nbsp;was 18&nbsp;years old, I’ve heard from my&nbsp;granny say that&nbsp;I should have children, the clock is&nbsp;ticking. I’m 26&nbsp;now, and&nbsp;I have a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;nephews and nieces. Granny has to&nbsp;babysit with a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;them. Recently, we&nbsp;were sitting and watching the children play, and she suddenly said, “Take your time having children. It’s so&nbsp;tiring and hard. You can do&nbsp;so&nbsp;many interesting things, so&nbsp;take your time!” <a href=#>©&nbsp;nikto.drugoy&nbsp;/ Pikabu</a></li></ul><p>Do&nbsp;you have interesting stories about your grandmother?

Her connection with <a href=# title=Barbie data-link=tag>Barbie</a> dolls began in&nbsp;early childhood when her grandfather gifted her these dolls. “I&nbsp;was very feminine and used to&nbsp;play with dolls and wear my&nbsp;mum’s dresses and heels,” she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>shared.</a> Growing up, Alves was a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>reserved</a> child and often struggled with self-doubt about her appearance. As&nbsp;she entered adulthood, she chose to&nbsp;undergo <a href=# title="plastic surgery" data-link=tag>plastic surgery</a> to&nbsp;address her body-related concerns.</p><p><h2>In&nbsp;2018, she became known as&nbsp;a&nbsp;real-life version of&nbsp;the Ken doll and invested around half a&nbsp;million dollars in&nbsp;cosmetic procedures.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b5c/f14/d90c5c50cb860c8c105d952831.jpg><p>AP Photo / Kirsty Wigglesworth / AP / Associated Press / East News</p><p>By&nbsp;age 35, Alves had undergone countless <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>cosmetic treatments</a>. When Jessica Alves reached 35&nbsp;years old, she experienced numerous <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>cosmetic procedures</a>, which she estimated cost more than $500,000. During this time, she was still using the name Rodrigo and her distinctive blonde hair and well-defined features led to&nbsp;her being called the ’human Ken doll’. She had invested a&nbsp;significant amount in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>surgeries</a> like the ’cat eye lift’, multiple nose jobs, and enhancements to&nbsp;her figure.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e28/7f9/7d6bb1512c97342f602ea130a3.jpg><p>Vandeville Eric / ABACA / Abaca / East News</p><p><h2>In&nbsp;2020, Alves openly shared that she was transgender and underwent gender reassignment surgery.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/985/170/c46d40593bb929bc8afc989e75.jpg><p>In&nbsp;2020, Jessica Alves made a&nbsp;significant decision to&nbsp;share her truth with the world. She courageously revealed that she identified as&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>woman</a> and planned to&nbsp;undergo gender reassignment surgery. Reflecting on&nbsp;her journey, she expressed, “I’m known as&nbsp;Ken, but inside I’ve always felt like Barbie. For years&nbsp;I tried to&nbsp;live my&nbsp;life as&nbsp;a&nbsp;man. I&nbsp;had a&nbsp;fake six-pack put&nbsp;in, I&nbsp;had fake muscles in&nbsp;my&nbsp;arms, but&nbsp;I was lying to&nbsp;myself. I’m a&nbsp;woman and have always had a&nbsp;feminine brain. Now my&nbsp;body matches my&nbsp;mind.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f3d/d72/f15a59545a9d5f73347fcdaeeb.jpg><p>Jessica expressed her hope that her inner identity now aligns with how others perceive her, allowing them to&nbsp;see her authentic self. “Before, people looked at&nbsp;me&nbsp;because&nbsp;I looked very androgynous and weird for a&nbsp;man. Now I&nbsp;hope they are looking because they think I&nbsp;am a&nbsp;beautiful <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>woman</a>.”</p><p><h2>She’s now committed to&nbsp;putting an&nbsp;end to&nbsp;further procedures.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/95a/8a3/3eba6d5947b3a94980bf64db5d.jpg><p>Once Jessica revealed her transgender identity, she underwent further transformations to&nbsp;achieve a&nbsp;body that reflects her true self as&nbsp;a&nbsp;woman. She made changes like removing her abs and embracing a&nbsp;curvier shape, along with plumper lips and a&nbsp;more refined nose. By&nbsp;2023, the total <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>expenses</a> she had dedicated to&nbsp;cosmetic procedures reached an&nbsp;impressive $1&nbsp;million.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e19/79b/1c04545af7ad6d7c168c6861a4.jpg><p>It&nbsp;seems that Jessica Alves has found satisfaction with her body. She recently shared that she’s “100% done with plastic surgery.” She expressed joy by&nbsp;saying, “I&nbsp;look and feel amazing. I&nbsp;love being a&nbsp;woman, and&nbsp;I take pride in&nbsp;it. Growing&nbsp;up, in&nbsp;my&nbsp;mind, I&nbsp;had long hair and a&nbsp;voluptuous body shape, and today I&nbsp;am the woman of&nbsp;my&nbsp;dreams.”</p><p>Jessica Alves isn’t the only influencer who has undergone numerous cosmetic procedures. Dalia Naeem, a&nbsp;29-year-old woman from Iraq, has also earned the nickname ’human <a href=#>Barbie</a>’ due to&nbsp;her unique appearance.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZK5utNSmmKdlm5q7brDOpaNmq6Cau7V5kGakoqScnryvecOoo6WZoqh6sLqMqaOaq6SesG6%2F1KuenqqZmsBuwM5mo6inm2K5qrfEZphmmpGnr6qxjHFobW1naHw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

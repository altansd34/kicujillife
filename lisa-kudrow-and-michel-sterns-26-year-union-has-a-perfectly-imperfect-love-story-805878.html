So&nbsp;keep scrolling to&nbsp;get a&nbsp;glimpse of&nbsp;the romantic relationship of&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the happiest couples in&nbsp;<a href=# title=Hollywood data-link=tag>Hollywood</a>.</p><p><h2>When one door closes, another door always opens.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b7e/eea/bc05dc55eca989d261833c99fc.jpg><p>Lisa Kudrow was <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>born</a> in&nbsp;California. Unlike the character she played in&nbsp;the hit sitcom, Lisa is&nbsp;quite smart: she studied biology and worked with her father&nbsp;— a&nbsp;world-renowned headache specialist&nbsp;— for 8&nbsp;years.</p><p>Her brother’s childhood <a href=# title=friend data-link=tag>friend</a> convinced her to&nbsp;give acting a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>shot,</a> and, decades later, after being fired from the set of&nbsp;a&nbsp;TV show and rejected for roles she auditioned for, she became one of&nbsp;Hollywood’s biggest names. Her dedication, hope, and talent got her the audition of&nbsp;a&nbsp;lifetime, and the rest is&nbsp;history.</p><p><h2>It&nbsp;was love at&nbsp;first sight&nbsp;— but she kept it&nbsp;cool.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/197/b30/a0fb0b51f4a7919ab9af83b24a.jpg><p>It&nbsp;was in&nbsp;the 1980s when Lisa first saw Michel. The handsome French advertising executive was dating her French roommate at&nbsp;the time. Lisa had fallen for his charm but kept it&nbsp;to&nbsp;herself, admiring him whenever he&nbsp;came around to&nbsp;meet his then-girlfriend.</p><p>Lisa was afraid that people would be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;tell she liked him. She used to&nbsp;get nervous and act strange, to&nbsp;the point that she’d say hi&nbsp;back to&nbsp;him in&nbsp;a&nbsp;rush and leave the room whenever he&nbsp;came to&nbsp;pick up&nbsp;her roommate. She made quite an&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>impression</a> on&nbsp;him, as&nbsp;he&nbsp;thought she was a&nbsp;freak. However, her politeness took over these situations, and she’d do&nbsp;her best to&nbsp;stay calm around him.</p><p><h2>They found each other and never let&nbsp;go.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/aab/35c/291c465c798f1d4ef745a1ead7.jpg><p>Kudrow’s roommate and Michel called it&nbsp;quits after some time, and Lisa stumbled upon her crush at&nbsp;a&nbsp;birthday party 6&nbsp;years later. They were still friends then but turned their friendship into a&nbsp;romance that has been shining ever since. She <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a>, “I&nbsp;thought that that’s not nice to&nbsp;flirt. But the minute&nbsp;I saw him, I&nbsp;went, ’Well, that’s it, there he&nbsp;is.’”</p><p><h2>They built a&nbsp;beautiful family.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/243/acc/8cc54a5bddb9dd7fecb2f72bb7.jpg><p>The couple tied the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>knot</a> on&nbsp;May&nbsp;27, 1995, in&nbsp;Malibu, California. The ceremony was held privately, and we&nbsp;don’t have much information about the details. What we&nbsp;do&nbsp;know, though, is&nbsp;that it&nbsp;must’ve been the best day of&nbsp;their lives.</p><p>Their son, Julian Murray, was born 3&nbsp;years later. He&nbsp;was also in&nbsp;<i>Friends</i> while he&nbsp;was in&nbsp;his mother’s belly, since Lisa was pregnant in&nbsp;the fourth season of&nbsp;the show. As&nbsp;a&nbsp;result of&nbsp;her pregnancy, the writers made Phoebe a&nbsp;surrogate mother to&nbsp;brother Frank and his wife Alice in&nbsp;the series.</p><p><h2>Commitment is&nbsp;what made it&nbsp;work.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/bd2/137/df69d75b3e9490c2f7e2d1ecaa.jpg><p>We&nbsp;have to&nbsp;admit that falling in&nbsp;love and getting married is&nbsp;easy, but committing to&nbsp;your partner and working on&nbsp;difficulties is&nbsp;what makes marriages work. Lisa seemed to&nbsp;know the recipe from the beginning because, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>according</a> to&nbsp;her, you don’t promise to&nbsp;love someone forever, but you promise to&nbsp;work on&nbsp;whatever problems come&nbsp;up. The real deal is&nbsp;to&nbsp;commit to&nbsp;making the marriage work because, after you have a&nbsp;history, it&nbsp;becomes a&nbsp;bond, not a&nbsp;simple crush.</p><p>The actress also shared in&nbsp;an&nbsp;interview that independence is&nbsp;key to&nbsp;a&nbsp;great marriage. She advised couples to&nbsp;stick to&nbsp;their independence, as&nbsp;she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>did</a> with her husband. They respect each other’s individuality, they have their own goals and achievements, but they know they’re on&nbsp;the same team.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/261/3d9/47171c5e1eb20832fc99f78a8d.jpg><p>Their marriage of&nbsp;26&nbsp;years has surely seen ups and downs, but their commitment to&nbsp;each other made it&nbsp;work. The iconic&nbsp;TV star and her husband are the kind of&nbsp;people you’d actually want advice from on&nbsp;your own friendships, love, and life in&nbsp;general.</p><p><h2>Bonus: Lisa’s story in&nbsp;<i>Friends</i> also ended happily at&nbsp;the end of&nbsp;the show.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/fa4/eb4/bfd5c756da90ae6c3282a261ec.png><p>Phoebe Buffay (Lisa) had an&nbsp;interesting love life. Her first marriage was to&nbsp;a&nbsp;Canadian ice skater who needed a&nbsp;green card. Then she had a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>brief</a> affair in&nbsp;Las Vegas that turned into a&nbsp;quick out-of-the-blue marriage, which according to&nbsp;Phoebe, doesn’t count because “if&nbsp;you get married in&nbsp;Vegas, you’re only married in&nbsp;Vegas.”</p><p>The blond beauty finally found love when she married Mike. We&nbsp;were able to&nbsp;see the affection and respect they had for each other and their shared desire to&nbsp;have kids. On&nbsp;the other hand, Lisa’s fate was not far from her character’s. Although the charming actress didn’t get married 3&nbsp;times, she surely found her soulmate and started her own <a href=# title=family data-link=tag>family</a>.</p><p>Do&nbsp;you have a&nbsp;marriage success story of&nbsp;your own that you’d like to&nbsp;share? We’d love to&nbsp;hear about&nbsp;it!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLmqv8Bmoq6coqTEbq3NnWSmoZOdsq150q2cq6ajYn93ediemKtlpaO2sLqMoZisZZFivaa%2BxZ6araSpYrauvMSrnZ6bpGK5sMLEZqqtp6Kuenl8lHFucWc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

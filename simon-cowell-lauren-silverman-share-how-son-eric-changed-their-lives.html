Cowell said he didn’t expect to be a dad, but since having a child he has “looked at life in a completely different way.”</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-simon-cowell-lauren-silverman-talk-about-son-eric>Simon Cowell, Lauren Silverman Talk About Son Eric</h2><p>Cowell and Silverman recently spoke to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">HELLO!</a> in a joint interview after a charity event for the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">London Music Fund</a>. They spoke about their son Eric, who turned 10 earlier this year. Cowell said that 20 years ago, he “didn’t think I was going to have kids because I thought I was too old.”</p><p>“So when I got the news I was going to be a dad – and the first time I saw his scan – I was literally obsessed. Something changed and I looked at life in a completely different way,” Cowell explained. “Every decision I make now&nbsp;I am thinking about Eric. Is it the right decision for him?”</p><p>Silverman called Cowell a “workaholic” who used to stay up “until crazy hours,” adding that he “sometimes needs me and Eric to push him to do more normal things and get up at a reasonable hour.” She said Cowell has “definitely got a lot better since we first met.”</p><p class=has-text-align-left><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">SIMON COWELL WAS ‘NERVOUS’ TO WALK ‘X FACTOR’ STAR LUCY SPRAGGAN DOWN THE AISLE</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-silverman-says-cowell-had-something-missing-before-fatherhood>Silverman Says Cowell Had ‘Something Missing’ Before Fatherhood</h2><p>“I think before he had Eric his life was great, and he had so much success,” Silverman said of Cowell’s lifestyle before parenthood. “But there was definitely a void, something missing. And maybe he didn’t even know what that thing was.”</p><p>She shared her belief that starting a family made Cowell realize “that actually there’s so much more to life and what’s the point of having all this if you don’t have somebody you want to share it with?”&nbsp;</p><p>Cowell and Silverman <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">got engaged</a> over the Christmas holiday in 2021. Since then, Cowell has talked about <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">planning the wedding</a>, but the couple has yet to walk down the aisle.

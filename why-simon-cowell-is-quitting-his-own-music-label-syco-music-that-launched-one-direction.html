Now he’s going in a different direction. But why is Simon cutting ties?</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/BS6YQZcFwwy/</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Simon Cowell Leaves Syco Music</h2><p>According to <a href=#>Capital FM</a>, Simon is walking away from Syco (which he sold to Sony Music in 2005) in order to focus more on his TV company Syco Entertainment, which produces America’s Got Talent and Britain’s Got Talent.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>RELATED:</strong> <strong><a href=# class=broken_link>WHAT DOES LOUIS TOMLINSON’S SPLIT FROM SIMON COWELL’S LABEL SYCO MEAN FOR HIS MUSIC CAREER?</a></strong></p><p>“This deal is huge. Simon has had to pay a massive amount to regain control of Syco Entertainment,” a source reportedly said. “That has meant he is no longer involved in Syco Music but it’s not in great shape right now. Leaving it now makes sense for him because he can instead focus on his Got Talent shows, as those are his money-makers now.”</p><p>Indeed, <a href=#>Deadline</a> reports that Simon recently bought out Sony Music Entertainment’s stake in Syco Entertainment, taking full control of the company. Louis Tomlinson, meanwhile, tweeted about his separation from Syco last weekend, <a href=#>writing</a>, “I’m really excited for the future and to be back in the studio writing the next album.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/BIp_V-rBoXe/</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading>What Are Simon’s Plans For The Future?</h3><p>Simon has apparently been getting a lot ideas during quarantine.

I’m very excited.”</p><p>“I’ve always believed it’s important to take on new goals in order to drive new ideas and creativity,” Simon added, “so I’m very excited to be taking an independent and creatively-led Syco Entertainment into the future.”</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/simon-cowell-stops-audition-agt.jpeg alt="10 Singers Simon Cowell Stopped Midway Through Their Auditions" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK571qGwZquZoryvecKorp6knGK2tHnQrqCtrJmjtG60yKxkqK%2BeYrq2v8icZKWZkpq5br%2FYnKZmpaWotqR506GYrWWclsKvr8eem2annpp6pbXRnpqtoZ%2BjfA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

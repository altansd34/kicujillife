In honor of Rodrigo’s latest album GUTS, the two singers opened up about the gutsiest moments of their careers. Clarkson also got a kick out of a tiny detail on Rodrigo’s tour.</strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-olivia-rodrigo-kelly-clarkson-talk-gutsy-moments>Olivia Rodrigo, Kelly Clarkson Talk Gutsy Moments</h2><p>When talking about gutsy moments, Clarkson shared that she likes to get tattoos “when not great things happen … because I like the reminder that I made it.” She brought up one tattoo in particular, on her middle finger. It’s the letters “DC.”</p><p>“Someone was so vicious, and I was so tired of sitting in a room where men just made me feel like sh*t,” Clarkson said of the tattoo’s backstory. “And I was like, ‘You know what? Nope.’ I actually had the guts to finally say … ‘Actually, I think this about you.’ And I just totally said everything I’ve ever wanted to say in that moment.”</p><p>As for Rodrigo, she shared that the second time she performed in her career was on Saturday Night Live when she was just 18 years old. She said she was “terrified,” and she wondered if she deserved to be there.</p><p>“But I did it anyway,” Rodrigo said. “That was brave of me. But not quite as beautiful as your story.”</p><p class=has-text-align-left><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">OLIVIA RODRIGO TAKES THE STAGE WITH SHERYL CROW FOR A SOLID DUET AT 2023 ROCK & ROLL HALL OF FAME</a></strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-rodrigo-shares-how-she-decorates-her-in-ears>Rodrigo Shares How She Decorates Her In-Ears</h2><p>During their conversation, Rodrigo and Clarkson also talked about how they decorate their in-ear monitors when they’re performing. Clarkson said she opted for “gold, sparkly, ’70s.” She was blown away that you can apparently put photos on them.</p><p>That’s exactly what Rodrigo did with hers. On her SOUR tour, she chose to decorate her in-ears with photos of Edward Cullen from the Twilight movies. She called him her “guiding light on tour.” Lately, she’s opted for photos of Samanta from Sex and the City.</p><p>For her GUTS tour next year, Rodrigo said she was taking suggestions for whose photo to put on her in-ears. Clarkson suggested that she should put pictures of Betty White.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Original_GwenStefani_BIAS-220x147.jpg alt="Fans Criticize Gwen Stefani for Her Artist’s Performance on ‘The Voice’" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57zqWgr6GRYr%2BwsNGinqhlm5q5rcWMnKOaqpuovK950qGYq51dqbWmecauq6yhlajBbrnOppynrKNivKd506GcoqpdmK6zscSrqmg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

She was a massive fan-favorite on the show and her Top 7 elimination came as a shock. But it was her connection to controversial YouTuber Shane Dawson that launched her career after American Idol.</strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-catie-turner-became-a-frontrunner-on-american-idol-in-2018>Catie Turner Became A Frontrunner On ‘American Idol’ In 2018</h2><p>From the second Catie entered the American Idol audition room, the entire world fell in love with her. She was full of adrenaline singing her original song “21st Century Machine.” Katy Perry called her “a spectacular songwriter.” The judges praised her for her unique perspective on modern technology and social media and sent her to Hollywood.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>10 BEST ORIGINAL SONGS IN ‘AMERICAN IDOL’ AUDITIONS</a></strong></p><p>Once in Hollywood, Catie struck up a great friendship with fellow contestant Zach D’Onofrio. Though Zach was cut during the first round, Catie had a clear path to the Top 24. The 17-year-old was unstoppable in the competition.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>Catie blew everyone away with her rendition of “Take Me to Church” by Hozier which helped send her to the Top 10.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-when-did-she-get-eliminated>When Did She Get Eliminated?</h3><p>Fans of American Idol were sure that Catie would make it to the finale and have a shot at winning the prize. However, in the Top 7 during her performance of “Manic Monday” by The Bangles, Catie forgot the lyrics. She recovered quickly and added extra energy into the song.</p><p>“Catie you have been in this competition since day one and you have not had one glitch so what just happened to you is ok darling,” Luke Bryan said after the performance. “It happens.”</p><p>Lionel Richie applauded Catie for how well she recovered after forgetting the lyrics. That night, Catie was shockingly eliminated from the competition along with fellow contestant Jurnee.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-how-shane-dawson-helped-launch-catie-turner-s-career-after-american-idol>How Shane Dawson Helped Launch Catie Turner’s Career After ‘American Idol’</h3><p>Sometimes when a contestant thrives on American Idol, the show does not do much afterward to help that contestant further their career. But in 2019, Catie’s life changed when her song “Prom Queen” was featured in the trailer for The Beautiful World of Jeffree Star. The documentary created by Shane starts out with Catie singing “Prom Queen.”</p><p>The song completely captivated the 13.9 million viewers that watched the trailer. Shane was a big fan of Catie’s when she was on American Idol. The pair struck up a bond online before he asked her if he could use “Prom Queen” for his trailer. The song now has over 16 million streams on Spotify.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-why-did-she-end-up-in-the-hospital>Why Did She End Up In The Hospital?</h3><p>Almost immediately after the success of her song “Prom Queen” Catie had a brief hospital stay. She posted a photo <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>wearing a hospital gown</a> and was hooked up to an IV bag. Fans took to the comments to express their concerns for the singer who later tweeted that she had a kidney infection. She was given morphine to cope with the pain.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B6Be_PwFaEr/?utm_source=ig_embed</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-where-is-catie-turner-now>Where Is Catie Turner Now?</h3><p>Catie and Zach are happily dating and share glimpses of their adorable relationship on social media.

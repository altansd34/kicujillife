The research was carried out at the end of last week – before the measures were announced on Monday.</p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/tube20worst3.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>On the other hand, the Jubilee line is London’s favourite tube line, chosen by almost a quarter (24%) of Londoners, just ahead of the Victoria Line (19%) in second place.

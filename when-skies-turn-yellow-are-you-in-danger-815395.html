Dust storms, pollen, <a href=# title=smoke data-link=tag>smoke</a> in&nbsp;the <a href=# title=atmosphere data-link=tag>atmosphere</a>... <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><u>A&nbsp;yellow sky doesn’t necessarily mean a&nbsp;tornado is&nbsp;on&nbsp;the way</u></a>, and you need to&nbsp;search for shelter. In&nbsp;fact, any kind of&nbsp;storm cloud may cause the sky to&nbsp;look eerily yellowish. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><u>The clouds scatter the short-wave blue light</u></a> coming from the <a href=# title=Sun data-link=tag>Sun</a>, and from our perspective on&nbsp;Earth, the sky might look yellow. So, there’s no&nbsp;reason to&nbsp;connect it&nbsp;with an&nbsp;approaching hurricane or&nbsp;tornado. In&nbsp;the worst-case scenario, you might need to&nbsp;get ready for a&nbsp;regular thunderstorm.</p><p>Just keep in&nbsp;mind that even though yellow skies do&nbsp;look haunting and unnatural, it&nbsp;doesn’t mean the end of&nbsp;the world. Just check local weather reports to&nbsp;find out the reason for this phenomenon. If&nbsp;you come across an&nbsp;article about sand storms, pollen, or&nbsp;wildfires or&nbsp;if&nbsp;meteorologists are getting ready for storms, you’ll know what’s going&nbsp;on.</p><p>Another common wisdom in&nbsp;the Central U.S. and other tornado-prone regions claims that once you see <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><u>the sky turn green during a&nbsp;thunderstorm</u></a>, you gotta gather up&nbsp;your loved ones and rush for the cellar! A&nbsp;twister is&nbsp;on&nbsp;the way! But from the point of&nbsp;view of&nbsp;<a href=# title=science data-link=tag>science</a>, there’s little evidence to&nbsp;prove this belief. At&nbsp;the same time, green skies might mean bad thunderstorms. Over the past 15&nbsp;years, a&nbsp;group of&nbsp;scientists has been examining green thunderstorms, noting down their observations. They confirm that green skies often go&nbsp;hand in&nbsp;hand with severe weather. But they haven’t noticed any direct connection to&nbsp;hail or&nbsp;tornadoes.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/286/7d1/813e9b5fad9a656f6e382260fe.png><p>Another question&nbsp;is, “Are green skies real, or&nbsp;is&nbsp;it&nbsp;just a&nbsp;mesmerizing optical illusion caused by&nbsp;light reflected off the ground back up&nbsp;to&nbsp;the sky?” Well, experts haven’t come to&nbsp;any conclusion yet. But most of&nbsp;them point to&nbsp;the liquid water the air contains. These moisture particles are so&nbsp;tiny they might bend the light and make the observer perceive it&nbsp;in&nbsp;a&nbsp;different way. These droplets absorb red light, which makes the scattered light appear blue.</p><p>And at&nbsp;certain times, for example, during sunset, this blue light might look greenish. There have been other cases of&nbsp;bizarre sky colors in&nbsp;many countries around the globe. Let’s have a&nbsp;look at&nbsp;some of&nbsp;them. For example, this incident occurred in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><u>Japan on&nbsp;October&nbsp;12, 2019</u></a>. The phenomenon of&nbsp;a&nbsp;bright purple sky, known as&nbsp;a&nbsp;scattering phenomenon, turned out to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;sign of&nbsp;a&nbsp;terrible storm. It&nbsp;was followed by&nbsp;Typhoon Hagibis, whose speed reached almost 100 mph at&nbsp;its center.</p><p>On&nbsp;May&nbsp;7, 2022, the sky turned <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><u>blood-red in&nbsp;the Zhoushan</u></a> area of&nbsp;<a href=# title=China data-link=tag>China</a>. It&nbsp;looked really scary and made lots of&nbsp;people panic. But the local Bureau of&nbsp;Meteorology explained that there was nothing sinister about the red sky. The phenomenon was most likely caused by&nbsp;refraction and scattering of&nbsp;light coming from the ships in&nbsp;the port. Besides clouds, you can see many other phenomena in&nbsp;the sky above your head.</p><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><u>Their scientific name is&nbsp;“photometeors,”</u></a> where “photo” stands for “light,” and “meteor” refers to&nbsp;literally anything in&nbsp;the sky. These visual phenomena appear when the light from the Sun or&nbsp;the <a href=# title=Moon data-link=tag>Moon</a> interacts with something in&nbsp;the atmosphere of&nbsp;our planet&nbsp;— which is&nbsp;most often water in&nbsp;one of&nbsp;its forms. I&nbsp;bet you know at&nbsp;least two of&nbsp;such photometeors&nbsp;— those are a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><u>rainbow and a&nbsp;moonbow</u></a>. <a href=# title=Rainbows data-link=tag>Rainbows</a> form when sunlight passes through water droplets, like rain or&nbsp;fog. As&nbsp;for moonbows, they’re way fainter than rainbows, and their colors are more muted or&nbsp;non-existent.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/80e/abc/851ce0551d8754964731f566b2.png><p>Another phenomenon you might spot in&nbsp;the sky is&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><u>a&nbsp;halo around the Sun or&nbsp;the Moon</u></a>. It’s usually a&nbsp;shining white ring with our star or&nbsp;Earth’s natural satellite at&nbsp;the center. Sometimes you can spot a&nbsp;red fringe on&nbsp;the inside&nbsp;or, more rarely, a&nbsp;violet ring on&nbsp;the outside of&nbsp;the halo. Halos appear when sunlight or&nbsp;moonlight is&nbsp;refracted or&nbsp;reflected by&nbsp;ice crystals floating high in&nbsp;the atmosphere. Solar halos are more prominent than lunar ones because of&nbsp;the difference in&nbsp;the intensity of&nbsp;light.</p><p>If&nbsp;you ever see one or&nbsp;several narrow and more faintly colored bands next to&nbsp;a&nbsp;rainbow’s violet edge, those are supernumerary bands, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><u>aka a&nbsp;stacker rainbow</u></a>. The tinier the water droplets in&nbsp;the air are, the broader and less saturated such bands become. Bright spots that appear on&nbsp;one or&nbsp;even both sides of&nbsp;the Sun are called <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><u>“sun dogs” or&nbsp;“parhelion.”</u></a> This phenomenon occurs when ice crystals refract sunlight. The spots themselves may look like bright patches or&nbsp;have some color to&nbsp;them&nbsp;— blue on&nbsp;the outside and red on&nbsp;the inside.</p><p>If&nbsp;you spot <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><u>a&nbsp;small rainbow-like ring surrounding your shadow, that’s a&nbsp;glory</u></a>. Just like its big sibling, a&nbsp;glory can only be&nbsp;seen directly opposite to&nbsp;the sun. This phenomenon is&nbsp;most often observed by&nbsp;mountain climbers who see glories cast onto clouds below their vantage points. Glories can also surround the shadow of&nbsp;airplanes cast onto the clouds over which they’re flying.</p><p>Now, let’s talk about <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><u>auroras</u></a>. This stunning phenomenon is&nbsp;also called northern lights when it&nbsp;occurs in&nbsp;the Northern Hemisphere and southern lights when it&nbsp;takes place in&nbsp;the Southern Hemisphere. Auroras happen in&nbsp;Earth’s upper atmosphere. They’re caused by&nbsp;fast-moving solar winds that strike the planet’s magnetic bubble called the magnetosphere. Auroras can take different shapes, from arcs and luminous curtains to&nbsp;patches and bands.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/b8f/19a/7d470f5a9ca10814ad0be76eb0.png><p>You can only see <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><u>a&nbsp;supermoon</u></a> (which looks like a&nbsp;huge bright ball in&nbsp;the night sky) three or&nbsp;four times a&nbsp;year. It’s 13% bigger and&nbsp;30% brighter than a&nbsp;regular full moon. You can observe this phenomenon when the Moon reaches its perigee&nbsp;— that’s the closest the satellite comes to&nbsp;Earth in&nbsp;its elliptical orbit. Giant and orange, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><u>a&nbsp;harvest moon</u></a> appears in&nbsp;the sky close to&nbsp;the beginning of&nbsp;fall. In&nbsp;the times before electricity, farmers had to&nbsp;depend on&nbsp;the full moon’s light to&nbsp;harvest crops late into the night&nbsp;— hence the name.</p><p>And look at&nbsp;this breathtaking view! These clouds are called <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><u>“iridescent clouds.”</u></a> They form on&nbsp;top of&nbsp;cotton-like cumulus clouds after thunderstorms. Cumulus clouds are low-level ones and usually hover at&nbsp;a&nbsp;height not higher than 6,000&nbsp;ft. When water vapor in&nbsp;them condenses, water droplets act as&nbsp;prisms, forming multicolored caps over the clouds. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><u>Fogbows are almost white</u></a><u>,</u> with pale blues on&nbsp;the inside and faint reds on&nbsp;the outside. You have higher chances of&nbsp;seeing a&nbsp;fogbow over water when warm air comes into contact with much colder water. This phenomenon also occurs when the sun is&nbsp;bright and the fog is&nbsp;thin enough for the light to&nbsp;get through.</p><p>Ever seen huge round discs in&nbsp;the sky? Most likely, those were <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><u>lenticular clouds</u></a>. They usually form over large and high places, like mountains or&nbsp;hills. When strong wind bumps into some barrier, this creates an&nbsp;air wave. The air kinda wraps around the obstacle. And the higher the barrier&nbsp;is, the colder the air that’s rising over it&nbsp;becomes. At&nbsp;some point, the moisture it&nbsp;contains turns into water droplets. And they form these unusual clouds. Lenticular clouds can look like waves, a&nbsp;pizza, or&nbsp;even a&nbsp;stack of&nbsp;pancakes.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/306/74c/6902705c8da40b137bd769b9f1.png><p>Now, this next phenomenon kinda terrifies&nbsp;me. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><u>Lightning balls are small floating spheres of&nbsp;light</u></a>. They can be&nbsp;orange, yellow, or&nbsp;even red. Sometimes, lightning balls descend from the sky. In&nbsp;other cases, they appear out of&nbsp;nowhere, hovering several feet above the ground.</p><p>They don’t emit any heat and produce very little sound. Lightning balls can bounce off objects. If&nbsp;they come across something electrical, like a&nbsp;TV, they usually disappear with a&nbsp;quiet “pop,” leaving behind the smell of&nbsp;sulfur. But lightning balls can also start fires or&nbsp;explode. Scientists believe this phenomenon might be&nbsp;connected with thunderstorms, but there’s no&nbsp;solid proof yet.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZMSpsc1mqqShlah6tcHRp2SynZyhvLh5wKucZrGfqnqquoydmKeflad6eX2UbHBuZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

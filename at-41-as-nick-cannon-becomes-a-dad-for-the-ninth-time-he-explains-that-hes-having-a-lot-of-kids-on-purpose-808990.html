The baby’s mom is&nbsp;a&nbsp;model who has appeared on&nbsp;Nick’s music game show.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/223/133/26e05056e284cc2f7abe2d7907.jpg><p><strong>6&nbsp;months later</strong>, in&nbsp;January 2022, the proud dad announced that his family would be&nbsp;expanding once again. His<strong> eighth kid</strong>, baby Legendary Love, was born in&nbsp;July 2022. It&nbsp;was revealed that he&nbsp;was dating the baby’s mom, who is&nbsp;a&nbsp;model, "on-and-off for years.’’</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/d22/7fb/ea661d553389ea6c951a14e488.png><p>In&nbsp;<strong>August 2022</strong>, Nick <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>shared</a> on&nbsp;his Instagram that he&nbsp;and his second baby mama, Brittany Bell, will be&nbsp;having<strong> their third child together</strong>. They revealed the news via a&nbsp;series of&nbsp;photoshoots with Bell’s baby bump, and the happy couple is&nbsp;hugging each other. Their 2&nbsp;other kids also joined them during some of&nbsp;the photos and Nick captioned the video ’’Time Stopped and This Happened...’’</p><p>And on&nbsp;September 2022, Nick <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>announced</a> that his <strong>ninth baby</strong> was born. He&nbsp;shared the news on&nbsp;his Instagram, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>writing</a> ’’Once again Today I&nbsp;am in&nbsp;Awe of&nbsp;the Devine Feminine!’’</p><p><h2>Struck by&nbsp;tragedy</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/98c/576/caf8db55eeabbc76f8c53ab221.jpg><p>In&nbsp;December 2021, Nick had to&nbsp;face any parents’ worst fear ever. He&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>announced</a> that his 7th child, son Zen, had passed away from brain cancer only 5&nbsp;months after his birth. The devastated dad described his son’s mom as&nbsp;the ’’strongest woman’’ he’s ever seen, and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>thanked</a> his family for supporting him during this tough time and for ’’being so&nbsp;loving and not judgmental’’ of&nbsp;him.</p><p>Needless to&nbsp;say, losing his son has had a&nbsp;huge impact on&nbsp;Nick’s life. In&nbsp;fact, back in&nbsp;October 2021, he&nbsp;made the decision to&nbsp;“try to&nbsp;be&nbsp;celibate at&nbsp;least until 2022.” This came after discovering that he’d be&nbsp;a&nbsp;dad for the eighth time, which made him feel that he’s become “<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>out of&nbsp;control</a>.” However, after losing his son, <i>The Masked Singer </i>host felt heartbroken and consequently broke his vow after just a&nbsp;month and a&nbsp;half of&nbsp;celibacy.</p><p><h2>Family comes first</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/368/858/1917ba54db851f1272c10bcb7a.jpg><p>Many people have and are still criticizing Nick regarding his ever-growing and “unconventional” family, yet he&nbsp;seems super content with his reality. He&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>admitted</a> to&nbsp;feeling “blessed with the gifts of&nbsp;children.” The TV&nbsp;host added, “I’ve been through so&nbsp;much, I&nbsp;find solace, I&nbsp;find peace in&nbsp;my&nbsp;children, and&nbsp;I find purpose.”<br></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ccf/e4a/3aae8c5688807ec9abd291a3a8.jpg><p>The devoted dad noted, “I’m a&nbsp;father, first and foremost.” However, one can wonder how the 41-year-old manages to&nbsp;spend time with his large family while having such a&nbsp;successful and busy career in&nbsp;parallel. Nick responded, “It’s not about quantity, it’s about quality. And it’s really just having quality moments with my&nbsp;children.”</p><p><h2>The women in&nbsp;his life</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/f55/26b/86e3eb52d0a38835c5cee82054.png><p>Having 6&nbsp;baby mamas proves that Nick’s views on&nbsp;family and relationships are somewhat unconventional and different from the societal norms. And as&nbsp;a&nbsp;matter of&nbsp;fact, he&nbsp;has opened up&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>saying</a> about the mothers of&nbsp;his kids, “The idea that a&nbsp;man should have one woman...we shouldn’t have anything.” He&nbsp;went&nbsp;on, adding, “I&nbsp;have no&nbsp;ownership over this person. It’s about what exchange we&nbsp;can create together.”</p><p><h2>More kids in&nbsp;the future?</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5b9/9c3/b642c851369e14d99125ca0754.jpg><p>Cannon insists on&nbsp;clarifying that he’s <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>having</a> ’’no accident’’ and that he’s “having these kids on&nbsp;purpose.” He&nbsp;explained, “Trust&nbsp;me, there’s a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;people that&nbsp;I could’ve gotten pregnant that&nbsp;I didn’t.” He&nbsp;then added, “The ones that got pregnant are the ones that were supposed to&nbsp;get pregnant.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/678/a77/754efd5e218c03f0199462e912.jpg><p>However, it&nbsp;seems that at&nbsp;some point, this soon-to-be father of&nbsp;10&nbsp;will be&nbsp;putting an&nbsp;end to&nbsp;his ever-expanding family. He&nbsp;wholeheartedly noted, “I&nbsp;don’t have the bandwidth for it&nbsp;anymore.” In&nbsp;fact, the dad revealed that he ’’already went and got my&nbsp;vasectomy consultation.’’ And he&nbsp;humorously <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>added</a>, ’’I ain’t looking to&nbsp;populate the Earth completely.’’</p><p>What do&nbsp;you think about Nick’s large family?

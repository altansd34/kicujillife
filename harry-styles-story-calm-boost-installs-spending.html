Data from Sensor Tower Inc., shared exclusively with Morning Consult, shows that during the week of July 5 -- when Styles’ story was announced and went live -- the Calm app was downloaded from the App Store and Google Play store 967,000 times globally, a 94 percent week-over-week increase, and downloaded 356,000 times in the United States, climbing 81 percent week-over-week."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Styles’ name was also the top keyword in user reviews during the week of July 5, per Sensor Tower. Styles is an investor in Calm.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Celebrity partnerships are a common marketing tactic for Calm. They have previously released stories narrated by the actors Matthew McConaughey, Nick Offerman and Danai Gurira and the singer Kelly Rowland, among others. But none of those collaborations have generated the amount of interest or revenue that Styles’ has. For example, U.S. installs were down 32 percent week over week when McConaughey’s story premiered and 13 percent lower when Rowland’s debuted.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Calm declined to comment for this story.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiooqR7rrvRp6Cnn5Oku7TBy61lnKedZK6zwMico56rX52us77YZqqtsZyawG6%2F06ipsmWTlrmuecGopqysXZ67tMDApaOsZaOlsq%2BwyKee</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

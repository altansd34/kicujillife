During the show, Lambert seemed to throw a little bit of shade at Katy Perry’s upcoming new single “Woman’s World.”</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-adam-lambert-throws-shade-at-katy-perry-s-new-song>Adam Lambert Throws Shade at Katy Perry’s New Song</h2><p>During Lambert’s appearance on WWHL, he participated in a game called “Do Gay Guys Give a Damn?” His fellow guest, Daily Show host Jordan Klepper (who is straight), had to guess whether gay men care about certain pop culture topics.</p><p>The first topic was Katy Perry’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">upcoming single “Woman’s World.”</a> Klepper guessed that “gay guys love this” and “can’t wait” to hear the song. Based on Lambert and Cohen’s reactions, he might not have been correct.</p><p>Lambert could be seen cringing when the song was brought up. He then shared, “I think all the gay guys I know were like, ‘Damn, her body looks dope.’ Like, she looks hot as…”</p><p>Cohen reacted to his comment by saying there was “some shade in there,” as it seemed like Lambert was trying to avoid talking about how the song sounded. Even Perry’s fans had some criticism of the track when they <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">heard the first teaser</a> last month.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">ADAM LAMBERT REVEALS WHY HE ALMOST DIDN’T DO ‘AMERICAN IDOL’ AFTER REALIZING HE WAS GAY</a></strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-lambert-chooses-who-should-replace-perry>Lambert Chooses Who Should Replace Perry</h3><p>The Katy Perry talk didn’t end with her song. During the show, a viewer called in to ask Lambert who he would choose to replace Perry on the American Idol judging panel next year. Perry recently left the show after seven seasons as a judge.</p><p>Cohen pointed out that Meghan Trainor has expressed interest in taking the gig, to which Lambert said she “would be great.” He also mentioned LeAnn Rimes as a possible replacement, explaining that he worked with her on The Voice in Australia.</p><p>“She is so lovely, so down-to-earth,” Lambert shared. “Very spiritual and deep, but great sense of humor. I think she’d be good on the show.”</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Original_RyanSeacrest_ABC_Stewart-Cook-220x147.jpg alt="‘Wheel of Fortune’ Fans Divided Over Promo with New Host Ryan Seacrest" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57w6KbZpmUlrpuuMCmmZ6qpGLBqb7OsGSsoJGZsm6t02aimqypYr2mvtGyqmamlax6tLvNoGY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

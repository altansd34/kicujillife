Less than one-fifth of Republicans held a negative view of the veteran journalist in a <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>survey prior to the debate</a>.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Trump pre-emptively claimed the debate would be unfair, predicting that Wallace would be “controlled by the radical left.” In the days since the debate, the president has frequently criticized Wallace online, tweeting an <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>image</a> of himself versus the Fox News anchor and his Democratic opponent, and retweeting several accounts that condemned Wallace for his job as moderator.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Fifty-seven percent of registered voters in the most recent poll said Wallace favored neither candidate, though voters were more likely, at 25 percent, to say Biden got preferential treatment than they were to say that Wallace favored Trump (8 percent). Republicans were split, with 43 percent saying Wallace favored Biden and 42 percent saying neither candidate was favored.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">A November 2018 Morning Consult <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>survey</a> placed Wallace as the fifth-most popular Fox News personality among Republicans — behind Tucker Carlson, Laura Ingraham, Ainsley Earhardt and Dana Perino — with a net favorability (the share of respondents with a favorable view minus the share with an unfavorable view) of 23 percentage points. His current net favorability, at 16 points underwater, would place him at the bottom of that list -- even below Shepard Smith, who <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>reportedly</a> broke a multiyear contract when he exited the news outlet in October 2019.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Wallace signed a <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>multiyear contract</a> with Fox News in September 2017, after nearly 15 years as the anchor for Fox News Sunday.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Most voters (71 percent) agreed that the president was the more interruptive presence at the debate, including 54 percent of Republicans. When it came to assessments of Wallace’s cat-herding capabilities on stage, voters were split on just how much he could have done to restore order.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Notably, partisans were largely united in their response to the question: About half agreed that Wallace “did the best he could” during the 90-minute broadcast and that “the candidates would not listen no matter what he said,” while a nearly equal share said he should have been “more assertive” with his moderating duties and “done more to guide the conversation.”</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">The Sept. 30 survey was conducted among 1,856 registered voters, including 1,277 registered voters who watched the debate, with respective 2- and 3-point margins of error.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiooqR7rrvRp6Cnn5Oku7TBy61lnKedZK6zwMico56rX5i1s7XSZq6apJyWsKZ5w56ZmqyVYrOiws6rmJuhnJ7BunnPqKOloZ6c</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

Even more touching if&nbsp;we&nbsp;mention the first smile of&nbsp;a&nbsp;newborn, also sometimes known as&nbsp;an&nbsp;angelic smile.

Is&nbsp;the baby dreaming? Are they remembering their time in&nbsp;mommy’s tummy?<strong> Bright Side</strong> asked these same questions and wanted to&nbsp;know what babies are hiding behind their dreamy smiles.</p><p><h2>Babies smile even before they are born.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/48a/064/b1c01b53028f709c0be11ca287.jpg><p>If&nbsp;you were lucky enough to&nbsp;see your baby smiling on&nbsp;an&nbsp;ultrasound, don’t think you were imagining things that weren’t happening. A&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>study</a> that looked at&nbsp;more than 500 pregnant women using 4D&nbsp;ultrasound, found that up&nbsp;to&nbsp;31&nbsp;fetuses were actually smiling. All of&nbsp;them smiled for an&nbsp;average time of&nbsp;3.21 seconds each. In&nbsp;this way, scientists determined that spontaneous smiles occur even when babies are still in&nbsp;the womb, and way prior to&nbsp;their birth.</p><p>Now, thanks to&nbsp;the <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>development</a> of&nbsp;new technologies that allow&nbsp;us to&nbsp;peek at&nbsp;babies inside their mother’s womb to&nbsp;see what’s going on&nbsp;in&nbsp;there before birth, it&nbsp;became possible to&nbsp;discover that fetuses can also yawn as&nbsp;early as&nbsp;18&nbsp;weeks after they were conceived. Around week 26&nbsp;of&nbsp;their gestation, they can smile, blink, and even cry from inside the womb&nbsp;— these facial expressions are involuntary reflexes they’re developing as&nbsp;a&nbsp;sort of&nbsp;preparation for the moment of&nbsp;birth.</p><p><h2>The first smiles are reflexive and involuntary acts.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b64/85a/cb8bc5592586ba74368b32c70d.jpg><p>As&nbsp;we&nbsp;mentioned earlier, these actions performed by&nbsp;the baby in&nbsp;the womb are considered to&nbsp;be&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>reflex actions</a>. That&nbsp;is, they are an&nbsp;immediate response to&nbsp;a&nbsp;stimulus, which in&nbsp;the case of&nbsp;babies is&nbsp;usually a&nbsp;feeling of&nbsp;internal well-being. Unlike many of&nbsp;us, it’s very likely that babies are actually not <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>aware</a> that they are smiling so&nbsp;we’re talking about an&nbsp;involuntary movement of&nbsp;their muscles, like when they kick or&nbsp;suck their thumb.</p><p><h2>The right time for smiles</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ed6/29d/f4764b55d8868a38b154a3c675.jpg><p>When sleeping, a&nbsp;newborn normally goes through <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>2</a>&nbsp;sleep phases: active sleep and deep sleep. The active phase, also known as&nbsp;REM which is&nbsp;an&nbsp;acronym for Rapid Eye Movement, is&nbsp;thought to&nbsp;be&nbsp;produced by&nbsp;intense brain activity. This occurs approximately 60-90 minutes after falling asleep, but sleep works in&nbsp;cycles, so&nbsp;REM will alternate with deep sleep as&nbsp;well. Nevertheless, it’s precisely during REM sleep that we&nbsp;will most likely see our babies smile, grimace, or&nbsp;stretch their legs, as&nbsp;involuntary acts of&nbsp;their body.</p><p><h2>Smiling as&nbsp;a&nbsp;response</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f40/f74/66b34f5adea9dfbf640a56e18a.jpg><p>Since they cannot talk, both smiling and crying are a&nbsp;baby’s basic means of&nbsp;<a href=# title=communication data-link=tag>communication</a>. This&nbsp;is, at&nbsp;least, true during their first moments after birth. However, you should also keep in&nbsp;mind that other separate sets of&nbsp;studies have managed to&nbsp;prove that babies are already <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>social beings</a> days or&nbsp;even hours after being born.</p><p>That is&nbsp;why their smiles can also be&nbsp;a&nbsp;response to&nbsp;positive feelings or&nbsp;soothing sensations such as&nbsp;a&nbsp;caress on&nbsp;the cheek or&nbsp;feeling clean again. Pleasant memories, like voices, aromas, and tastes can also trigger a&nbsp;smile on&nbsp;a&nbsp;baby.</p><p><h2>Newborns don’t dream, but they do&nbsp;have memory.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/40e/c47/d142e95c96918d138db6157ecf.jpg><p>And while we&nbsp;look at&nbsp;a&nbsp;baby that’s sleeping soundly we&nbsp;also often see him or&nbsp;her smile, that doesn’t necessarily mean that they’re dreaming even if&nbsp;that seems to&nbsp;be&nbsp;the case. In&nbsp;fact, this is&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>hardly possible</a>, since a&nbsp;newborn baby does not yet have enough experiences to&nbsp;remember, nor do&nbsp;they have the capacity to&nbsp;imagine, and their brain is&nbsp;still growing to&nbsp;gain those capacities.</p><p>Sleeping in&nbsp;the first weeks of&nbsp;life has some very specific functions which include helping babies to&nbsp;develop their brain, process information, and consolidate <a href=# title=memory data-link=tag>memory</a>, which does begin to&nbsp;take shape in&nbsp;the womb. The latter, in&nbsp;fact, can be&nbsp;proven by&nbsp;observing how <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>babies</a> can recognize their mother’s or&nbsp;father’s voice just hours after being born.</p><p>Anyway, we&nbsp;know well that the motive behind these smiles will never replace the feeling you get when you see them on&nbsp;your baby for the first time.

This Jamaican singer is one of the least-known winners of The X Factor, since he stayed out of the limelight after the show. Recently, he became a father and came out as pansexual. Here’s what Harris has been up to since winning The X Factor in 2018.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>He Now Has an Independent Musical Career</h2><p>In 2010, Harris became the youngest winner of Digicel Rising Star, a local talent show aiming to recognize Jamaica’s finest musical artists. Harris was awarded the cash price of JMD 1.5 million. Eight years after that, Harris entered <a href=#>The</a><a href=#>X Factor</a> and became the final winner of the UK-based singing competition.</p><p>He immediately landed a record deal with Simon Cowell’s record label Syco Music in addition to the prize money he obtained. Over the years, Harris has released songs such as&nbsp;“The Power of Love,”&nbsp;“Girl Like You,”&nbsp;and&nbsp;“Cry,”&nbsp;which&nbsp;all peaked in the top 10 of&nbsp;iTunes&nbsp;charts.</p><p>“I am no longer with a label, but I will remain independent as long as I feel is right.” Harris said. “I will not release music to chase momentum or popularity.”</p><p>Soon after, he severed ties with Syco Music and has remained an independent artist ever since. He made it clear that he was not cut from the record label and that the decision to leave the label was his choice.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-dalton-harris-became-a-father-came-out-as-pansexual>Dalton Harris Became a Father, Came Out as Pansexual</h2><p>The X Factor 2018 <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>winner</a> announced he is focusing on becoming a great father to his daughter. In addition to that, he’s also currently trying to improve on his emotional state of mind.</p><p>“I am trying to focus on being a great father to my daughter, a supportive friend/brother/son, and building a better relationship with myself,” he said.</p><p>Dalton shared selfie picture along with announcing the news on social media, he revealed that his time off was for his loved ones. Being there for his family while taking care of his mental health is a very smart move from <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the singer</a>.</p><p>In October 2020, Harris came out as pansexual, which was a freeing and empowering decision for the 28-year-old singer. He even considered himself as an advocate for human equality and respect.</p><p>“I live more freely and happily now. I feel so much more empowered and just full of life.” Harris said. “I can experience more healthy relationships as well. But also I now receive more death threats and hate than ever but it is how it is.”</p><p>He revealed that despite feeling good about coming out, the downside is that is comes with hate and death threats. He relocated to UK because it allowed him to feel more accepted than in his home country of Jamaica.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Original_AxelBlake_John-PhillipsGetty-Images-220x185.jpg alt="What Are The Winners of ‘Britain’s Got Talent’ Up to Now?" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>dalton harris</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>the x factor</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK571qGYrWWZqHq5ecWamq2nomLEqrrNnqlmnJGhwbC6jKGYq6qZqHq2vIytpmamn6x8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

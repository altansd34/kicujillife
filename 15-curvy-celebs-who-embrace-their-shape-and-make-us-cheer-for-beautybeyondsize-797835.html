Sure, the body positivity movement has paved the way for curvy women, but until they stop being called “brave” for loving themselves, our work here is&nbsp;far from over.</p><p>We&nbsp;at&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side </strong>turned our eyes toward the famous goddesses who help&nbsp;us feel more confident by&nbsp;simply being themselves and their words of&nbsp;self-love are something every woman needs to&nbsp;hear.</p><p><h2>1. Amy Schumer</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/651/c8f/544bbd55a9866832022e1e3c16.jpg><p>Schumer isn’t opposed to&nbsp;joking around about her size, which has served as&nbsp;material for many sketches on&nbsp;her Inside Amy Schumer <a href=#>show</a>. However, once, when a&nbsp;person on&nbsp;<a href=# title=Instagram data-link=tag>Instagram</a> <a href=#>criticized</a> her appearance, she didn’t stay silent and powerfully clapped back: “I&nbsp;like how&nbsp;I really look. That’s my&nbsp;body. <strong>I&nbsp;love my&nbsp;body for being strong and <a href=# title=healthy data-link=tag>healthy</a>.”</strong></p><p><h2>2. Jennifer Lopez</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/169/e5b/450171582b8f8c1ae5ea529d2d.jpg><p>For years, both men and women have been admiring J-Lo’s shapely figure. Although she’s proud of&nbsp;how she looks now, there were times when she was <a href=#>insecure</a> about her larger-than-average bottom: “I&nbsp;remember thinking&nbsp;I wasn’t thin enough because&nbsp;I had curves. But I’ve learned that <strong>being healthy and feeling great aren’t about having one specific body type</strong>&nbsp;— it’s a&nbsp;completely individual thing.”</p><p><h2>3. Kelly Clarkson</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/494/e01/19695b5d0c9fcb3bf4511b5548.jpg><p>The famous singer has gone through some weight fluctuations throughout the years, but they didn’t affect her beauty. Being in&nbsp;the public eye, Kelly knew she had to&nbsp;<a href=#>tune out</a> the <a href=# title=critics data-link=tag>critics</a> who always had their eye on&nbsp;her weight change:<strong> “I’ve just never cared what people think.</strong> It’s more about if&nbsp;I’m happy and I’m confident and feeling good. That’s always been my&nbsp;thing. And more so&nbsp;now, since having a&nbsp;family—I don’t seek out any other acceptance.”</p><p><h2>4. Beyoncé</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/6ea/32d/36196055db90669acaaf13f9e6.jpg><p>Beyoncé became one of&nbsp;the biggest inspirations to&nbsp;curvy women after coining the word <a href=#>“bootylicious”</a> and even officially getting it&nbsp;into the dictionary. She’s always stayed true to&nbsp;her shape and proudly flaunted her gifts to&nbsp;help others love themselves as&nbsp;well. She once <a href=#>said</a>: <strong>“We&nbsp;do&nbsp;not value ourselves enough.</strong> Especially young people, [who] don’t really appreciate how brilliant our bodies are.”</p><p><h2>5. Demi Lovato</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/dea/612/54c4e55640a3aedfd7e0753be2.jpg><p>Lovato <a href=#>struggled</a> with eating disorders for nearly a&nbsp;decade, but came out victorious on&nbsp;the other side. She used to&nbsp;look down on&nbsp;herself and <a href=#>doesn’t want</a> this to&nbsp;happen to&nbsp;other girls like her: “I&nbsp;was on&nbsp;Instagram and&nbsp;I started comparing myself to&nbsp;these&nbsp;IG models. I&nbsp;thought to&nbsp;myself; someone needs to&nbsp;show my&nbsp;fans and anybody that’s looking at&nbsp;my&nbsp;account that what you see isn’t always what’s real.” So&nbsp;<a href=# title=Demi data-link=tag>Demi</a> took the lead and posted her own un-retouched photos with the caption: <strong>“No&nbsp;thigh gap for&nbsp;me, and yet&nbsp;I still love myself.”</strong></p><p><h2>6. Lena Dunham</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7f9/e21/b9dabc52feb2d0ac8eb5af0e78.jpg><p>The Girls creator <a href=#>admits</a> that she has a&nbsp;complicated relationship with her body, but she accepts it&nbsp;as&nbsp;part of&nbsp;the process, and at&nbsp;the end of&nbsp;the day remembers to&nbsp;love herself: “I’ve never called myself ‘body positive,’ because my&nbsp;relationship with my&nbsp;curves and scars isn’t overtly political— it’s wildly personal. And it&nbsp;isn’t always positive. I&nbsp;take enormous comfort in&nbsp;the body positivity movement, but&nbsp;<strong>I think of&nbsp;myself as&nbsp;something more like ‘body tolerant.’”</strong></p><p><h2>7. Mindy Kaling</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/98a/b49/54b6935766a279173e64e1e39d.jpg><p>The shapely Ms. Kaling showed everyone that you don’t have to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;size 0&nbsp;to&nbsp;be&nbsp;the star of&nbsp;your own <a href=#>show</a>. She’s <a href=#>dealt</a> with insecurities her entire life, but now she’s confident and successful: “Being called fat, being called not pretty, these are just weapons that men can use against women that we&nbsp;can’t use against them. I&nbsp;am fairly impervious to&nbsp;when people say those things about&nbsp;me, because it’s like, well, <strong>I&nbsp;was born this way and&nbsp;I can’t really change that.”</strong></p><p><h2>8. Oprah Winfrey</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/dd2/c57/dbd2545a72875390d4f67c289f.jpg><p><a href=# title=Oprah data-link=tag>Oprah</a>’s <a href=#>words of&nbsp;wisdom</a> need to&nbsp;be&nbsp;taught in&nbsp;schools: <strong>“I&nbsp;think of&nbsp;all the years I’ve wasted hating myself fat, wanting myself thin.</strong> Feeling guilty about every croissant, then giving up&nbsp;carbs, then fasting, then dieting, then worrying when&nbsp;I wasn’t dieting, then eating everything&nbsp;I wanted until the next diet. All that <a href=# title=energy data-link=tag>energy</a>&nbsp;I could have spent loving what&nbsp;is.”</p><p><h2>9. Lizzo</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/962/949/e99e645bc180b63f18a78ab5ea.jpg><p>The successful <a href=#>singer</a> knows all too well what it’s like to&nbsp;want to&nbsp;be&nbsp;someone else. It&nbsp;took her <a href=#>accepting</a> her own body to&nbsp;become an&nbsp;unstoppable woman who’s now enjoying the fame and, most importantly, herself: “I&nbsp;remember one day being like, ‘This is&nbsp;it.’ 20-some-odd years of&nbsp;me&nbsp;believing that one day&nbsp;I can wake up&nbsp;and be&nbsp;some other girl. It’s like, you’re not gonna wake up&nbsp;and be&nbsp;bigger or&nbsp;smaller or&nbsp;lighter or&nbsp;darker; your hair’s not gonna suddenly grow down past your knees. <strong>You’re going to&nbsp;look this way for the rest of&nbsp;your life. And you have to&nbsp;be&nbsp;OK with that.”</strong></p><p><h2>10. Serena Williams</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d74/438/154b5c551b9fed2d9f80ec22e9.jpg><p>The legendary tennis <a href=#>player</a> sets a&nbsp;stellar example for her daughter by&nbsp;being proud of&nbsp;her body and <a href=#>celebrating</a> it&nbsp;for everything it&nbsp;has helped her achieve: “I&nbsp;was constantly told&nbsp;I was too muscular, or&nbsp;I wasn’t pretty enough to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;tennis player. I&nbsp;learned to&nbsp;ignore the negativity and look inwards to&nbsp;truly love myself... I&nbsp;love who I&nbsp;am... <strong>I&nbsp;love my&nbsp;body, my&nbsp;skin, my&nbsp;confidence and&nbsp;I fully embrace everything about&nbsp;me.”</strong></p><p><h2>11. Ashley Graham</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/fb9/23c/08eeda50ad933b35c6f94378c4.jpg><p>Graham became the first ever plus-size model to&nbsp;be&nbsp;<a href=#>featured</a> on&nbsp;the cover of&nbsp;the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue and since then she’s made the entire fashion world play by&nbsp;her rules. Ashley promotes beauty beyond size and <a href=#>preaches</a> to&nbsp;women that they need to&nbsp;be&nbsp;happy and healthy: “It&nbsp;doesn’t matter what size or&nbsp;shape you are. You can be&nbsp;healthy. <strong>It’s not just about our size.</strong> It’s about our mind, our heart, our emotions. We&nbsp;get so&nbsp;wrapped up&nbsp;in&nbsp;this size conversation.”</p><p><h2>12. Melissa McCarthy</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/0f5/9e3/eeb9615f10b15fe711104f801f.jpg><p><a href=#>McCarthy</a> never allowed Hollywood to&nbsp;dictate how she should look. She’d already won 2&nbsp;Emmy Awards and had been nominated for a&nbsp;Golden Globe and an&nbsp;Oscar, before she decided to&nbsp;lose some weight. Melissa has a&nbsp;full control over how she looks and <a href=#>knows</a> she’s her own woman: “With women, there’s this constant weird cultural thing where we’re always supposed to&nbsp;be&nbsp;comparing ourselves with one another. Who wore it&nbsp;best? Whose butt’s better? Instead, how about if&nbsp;everyone wins? <strong>How intensely boring would it&nbsp;be&nbsp;if&nbsp;we&nbsp;were all the same?”</strong></p><p><h2>13. Iskra Lawrence</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f44/58e/2809dc5c10b08f9a4ecf98f8f1.jpg><p>Lawrence is&nbsp;currently a&nbsp;successful plus-size <a href=#>model</a>, but she didn’t start out that way. Previously, Iskra struggled with trying to&nbsp;fit into fashion standards. It&nbsp;was a&nbsp;difficult time for her, but she was strong enough to&nbsp;<a href=#>accept</a> herself and that’s when she finally found her spot in&nbsp;the sun: “I&nbsp;was so&nbsp;confused about why my&nbsp;body was curvy. That’s when&nbsp;I became obsessed with my&nbsp;weight... When I&nbsp;looked in&nbsp;the mirror, I&nbsp;hated what I&nbsp;saw. [One day] I&nbsp;was like, <strong>’Okay, I’m different, and that’s what’s going to&nbsp;make me&nbsp;work.’</strong> I&nbsp;never wanted to&nbsp;diet again. Once I&nbsp;convinced myself that&nbsp;I could do&nbsp;this, I&nbsp;was able to&nbsp;convince [the agencies].”</p><p><h2>14. Rihanna</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/fb2/fb3/7dc9585a54ac3d8291916cfc3e.jpg><p>RiRi once <a href=#>confessed</a> that she has an&nbsp;unstable figure, which makes it&nbsp;easy for her to&nbsp;gain weight: “<strong>I&nbsp;actually have had the <a href=# title=pleasure data-link=tag>pleasure</a> of&nbsp;a&nbsp;fluctuating body type</strong>, where one day&nbsp;I can literally fit into something that is&nbsp;bodycon, and then the next day&nbsp;— the next week&nbsp;— I&nbsp;need something oversized; I&nbsp;need a&nbsp;little crop here and a&nbsp;high-waist there to&nbsp;hide that part, you know?” Still, it&nbsp;has no&nbsp;control over her confidence and she doesn’t let it&nbsp;bother her.</p><p><h2>15. Christina Aguilera</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/689/af7/6bda45574f9419f184cdc9ff44.jpg><p>Aguilera has also had to&nbsp;learn how to&nbsp;live with frequent weight gain and loss. Funnily enough, she realized that whatever size she&nbsp;is, someone will always be&nbsp;unhappy, but she <a href=#>knows</a> that it’s only her opinion that matters: “I’ve been through my&nbsp;highs, I’ve been through my&nbsp;lows... Being too thin. Being bigger. <strong>I’ve been criticized for being on&nbsp;both sides of&nbsp;the scale.</strong> It’s noise&nbsp;I block out automatically. I&nbsp;love my&nbsp;body.”</p><p>Have you ever struggled with self-acceptance? What helped you love yourself and stop caring about the opinion of&nbsp;others?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZH52ecKuqa%2BxXZiyrbHBrGSwoJ9isq6u0ZqanmWknbKqvoysn5qolWKur7CMppiknV2qwG6vx56cq2WWpL9ursSarK2xkprGsLrDrKCznV1shniEkm5m</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

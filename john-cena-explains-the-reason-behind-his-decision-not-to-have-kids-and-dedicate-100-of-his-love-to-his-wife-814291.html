Their love blossomed quickly, and after just a&nbsp;year and a&nbsp;half of&nbsp;dating, they decided to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>tie the knot</a> in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>secret</a> in&nbsp;October 2020.</p><p>Just before their joyful date, John Cena <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>tweeted</a> a&nbsp;heartfelt message: “When you are truly ready to&nbsp;let love in&nbsp;and give to&nbsp;love all it&nbsp;needs to&nbsp;flourish, I&nbsp;feel there is&nbsp;no&nbsp;greater more rewarding connection.” It’s clear that he&nbsp;was ready to&nbsp;embrace love and all the happiness it&nbsp;brings.&nbsp;2&nbsp;years later, Cena and Shariatzadeh had a&nbsp;proper <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>ceremony</a> to&nbsp;celebrate their love once again.</p><p><h2>John Cena has been clear that children are not part of&nbsp;his plan. He&nbsp;and his wife are content with their child-free lifestyle.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/8fa/240/e16fcc52c4af79d94e8692ee26.jpg><p>Evan Agostini/Invision/AP/East News</p><p>When it&nbsp;comes to&nbsp;expanding their <a href=# title=family data-link=tag>family</a>, Cena is&nbsp;taking his time. The <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Peacemaker</i></a> star shared that his acting career has taken off, keeping him busy and thoroughly enjoying his current life. He&nbsp;feels incredibly fortunate, having experienced opportunities beyond his wildest dreams.</p><p>Cena <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>emphasized</a> that every aspect of&nbsp;his life demands a&nbsp;lot from him, including being his best husband. Balancing everything can be&nbsp;challenging, leaving him with little energy to&nbsp;pursue additional aspirations.</p><p>He&nbsp;devotes considerable effort to&nbsp;caring for himself, being a&nbsp;loving partner to&nbsp;his wife, and maintaining connections with those he&nbsp;cares about. It’s evident that he&nbsp;puts his heart and soul into being the best version of&nbsp;himself for the people he&nbsp;loves.</p><p>It’s fascinating to&nbsp;note that despite believing he&nbsp;could excel as&nbsp;a&nbsp;parent, the 46-year-old actor doesn’t <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>consider</a> that reason compelling enough to&nbsp;pursue parenthood. According to&nbsp;him, being good at&nbsp;something isn’t sufficient; true passion and genuine drive are essential factors to&nbsp;consider before making such a&nbsp;life-changing decision. For John Cena, the desire to&nbsp;become a&nbsp;parent must come from the heart, filled with passion and genuine enthusiasm.</p><p><h2>However, the “kids” conversation is&nbsp;not entirely off the table.</h2></p><p>Currently, Cena isn’t <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>ready</a> to&nbsp;start a&nbsp;family with Shariatzadeh. However, reports suggest that having children isn’t entirely off the table for the couple. A&nbsp;close source revealed that <a href=#>John Cena</a> is&nbsp;gradually warming up&nbsp;to&nbsp;the idea and feels more prepared and responsible, especially with Shay.</p><p>Preview photo credit Evan Agostini/Invision/AP/East News<span>, </span>Evan Agostini/Invision/AP/East News</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLewtM1mmp6mkWKyubzLmqCnq12ptaZ50Z6YrKeeYq%2BmtMinm2agmah6pbHCoqqip55iu7DAjK2mZqCRq7Jut8idqmaZnpl6pbHDopqarJVifnF8jKidZqCZqHqtu9WeZK2nXZ22tHnWop2eZWhmgXOFkGg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

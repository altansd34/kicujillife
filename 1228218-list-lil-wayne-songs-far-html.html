He omitted the first letter D because of the resentment of his father, who left Wayne when he was two years old. Even the hard childhood did not prevent him from realising himself. Wayne embodied his aspirations in reality and came to the level he is right now, the musician is the owner of a music label and best selling rapper.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/0aa906237783f724.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Top Daddy Lumba songs: enjoy the masterpieces of the king</span></p></a><p class=align-left>He started writing his texts at the age of 8, at nine years he joined Cash Money records. The young rapper even decided to leave school and concentrate on his work. It shows the role music played in Lil Wayne’s life.</p><h2>Top 10 Lil Wayne songs of all time</h2><p class=align-left>Creating a list of all Lil Wayne songs is indeed a complex task; the number of his songs which have considerable importance is more than only 10. If you still do not know anything about the young rapper and his works you have a great chance to start an acquaintance with Lil Wayne’s music from the best songs ever.</p><h3>Lollipop</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/0aa906237783f724.png><p class=align-left>The vast majority of fans consider it the most popular in the Lil Wayne song list; it is rightly the national anthem of all his music. Lollipop entered to the album named Tha Carter III and was recorded with <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Static Major</a>, the famous musician and producer. Here Lil Wayne shows the experimental side of his music; he shows that he can not only technically rap but also sing. Lollipop song is full of melody and auto-tunes.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/d90a0f399e9dbd16.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Daddy Yankee net worth and amazing career</span></p></a><h3>Don't Cry</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/38faa1a1109d40b9.jpg><p class=align-left>It is one of the newest compositions from Tha Carter V album released in 2018. This track is unusual for Lil Wayne because of the excess emotionality. The producer of the song decided to add one recorded chorus of <a id=https://www.thefamouspeople.com/profiles/xxxtentacion-32895.php href=# rel="nofollow noopener">XXXTentacion</a>, who was killed in June 2018. The lyrics of Don't Cry fully reflect a lot of essential life problems and difficult situations every person should come through. Producers and Wayne created Don't Cry already after the X passed away. Lil decided to release the video on January 23, the birthday of X and paid tribute to the rapper.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> Top 25 Future songs so far</p><h3>A Milli</h3><p class=align-left>In 2008, A Milli was one of the most significant tracks. Some people hated it because they could not understand the lyrics full of metaphors, paraphrases and hidden meanings. It occupied the first places in various charts, all radio stations played it, and still, everyone remembers A Milli. Almost every Lil Wayne song deeply grabbed into the souls of listeners. And it is not just about new songs. If fans listen to tracks released ten years ago, it is the sign of popularity.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/420983283382dee7.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>You will never believe what DMX net worth is!</span></p></a><h3>6 Foot 7 Foot</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/d90a0f399e9dbd16.jpg><p class=align-left>This single belongs to Tha Carter IV album. Some people try to explain the name of the song as the reference to the time he spent in jail. The "6'7" is the size of a cell in prison. The track is a mixture of strong lyrics and beats which entirely complement it. Cory Gunz is the featuring artist. 6 Foot 7 Foot shows the power of Lil Wayne’s music to the whole world. In it, he announced himself the best rapper.</p><h3>Love Me</h3><p class=align-left>Love Me enters the I Am Not a Human Being II album. Lil chose the best performers to feature the hit: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">rapper Drake</a> and singer Future. Here they stood alone from difficult issues and devoted the song to women. Hot discussions about the girls' role in this track continue up till now. From the first glance, the matter of the song seems to be too unoriginal, but the due of every rapper is to create a banger about easy girls. The video helps to change the vision is the lyrics. Lil Wayne again did his best.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/78ef2b12b461bdbd.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Stitches rapper and his dramatic lifestyle</span></p></a><h3>Go, Dj</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/b2a53da95d488c03.jpg><p class=align-left>Many fans expressed the opinion that Go Dj is one of the most underestimated works of the early stage of Wayne’s development. Lil released it in 2004 within Tha Carter album. After this track, he stopped being a rising star. Wayne broke into the hip-hop scene, and the world recognised him.</p><h3>Uproar</h3><p class=align-left>The collaboration with<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> Swizz Beats </a>reveals all signs of modern hip-hop culture’s impact. However, it does not say that Wayne’s music sharply changes every year. He has the talent to be himself: he uses some new tricks but remains good old Wayne. The banger Uproar is the 4th single in the latest album named Tha Carter V.</p><h3>Fireman</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/420983283382dee7.jpg><p class=align-left>If you heard this song at least once you can proudly say you are Lil Wayne's fan. Fireman is the first song in Tha Carter II. Here we see the difference in the manner and flow. Even at that times, Fireman contained strong punches and fans disassembled a lot of quotations from this hit.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/e86e565b4c1ca196.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Top Lucky Dube songs for the reggae lovers</span></p></a><h3>Tha Block Is Hot</h3><p class=align-left>It is the single from the same name album, which was the first in Lil Wayne’s career. People who enjoy the creative activity of Wayne from the very beginning remember those feeling. It was the first official song from the young rapper they heard. Tha Block Is Hot is the most significant in every Lil Wayne songs list because it was a debut, the first step to success.</p><h3>I Feel Like Dying</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/9964e68634091388.jpg><p class=align-left>Everything here is ideally tailored: intriguing name with deep sense and melody, raising fear in the soul of the listener. Lil used a song written by Ann Swanepoel as a sample to create this masterpiece. The lyrics in I Feel Like Dying are autobiographical in some way because Wayne as far as many rappers had a drug addiction to find inspiration and so on.</p><h3>All Lil Wayne’s albums</h3><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/6047812c7e7beb62.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>These 15 greatest Brenda Fassie songs will blow your mind!</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The rapper's discography is vast, and it makes no sense to enumerate a full list of Lil Wayne songs; no one wants to read monotonous passages.

He was kicked out of his house at 18 years old for being gay but came to the show on season eight to show his parents what they were missing out on.</strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Jonathan Allen Impressed The ‘AGT’ Judges With Powerful Opera Singing</h2><p>“I want them to see what I’ve done with my life and I’m not a bad person and I really want them to see that,” Jonathan said about his family before his America’s Got Talent audition. “Show them what you’ve got and show them what they’re missing out on,” Howie Mandel told Jonathan. He sang “Time to Say Goodbye” and it definitely seemed like nobody expected him to be such an excellent opera singer. “You seem like a good person and you have a dream and you have a talent and your own family disowned you. But with your talent, this show has become your family and we’d like to say ‘welcome home'” Howie said. “You’ve got a gift. You have a way of making us feel an emotional connection” Howard Stern said. Heidi Klum said Jonathan was such a good singer that she questioned whether or not she was actually singing. Mel B also praised his performance.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>7 FAMOUS LGBT PRIDE MOMENTS IN ‘AGT’ HISTORY</a></strong></p><p>The judges all collectively agreed to send Jonathan into the Vegas Round.

Truth or dare</h3><p class=align-left>This is one of the most popular girl night games that will keep the party going. In this game, players are asked truth <a href=#>or dare</a>. If a person picks truth, they must answer a question; if they pick dare, they will have to do something other players can decide upon. They are not allowed to change their mind once they have made a choice, but they can pass the question. This, however, attracts a punishment.</p><h3>2. I went to the market to buy</h3><p class=align-left>This game starts with the question "I went to the market to buy…". You need to say something you can buy in a market and pass it on to the next person. They have to repeat what you said and add it to the list. The lists keep growing and might look like this: "I went to the market to buy tomatoes, mangoes, eggs, etc." If one forgets any item on the list, they are out.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/1d4bbf74c73a12ad.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>25 fun games to play with your boyfriend or girlfriend when bored</span></p></a><h3>3. Try to escape the room</h3><p class=align-left>What is more fun than a group of girls trying to escape a room? Put the girls in, lock them in turns in a room in the house, hide the key, and let them try to escape. Make sure there is a timer, and the fastest group wins.</p><h3>4. Two truths and a lie</h3><p class=align-left>When ladies' night games are mentioned, two truths and a lie cannot be left out. The idea here is to give three statements, two of which are true and one false. The girls must guess correctly which is which, and if they don't, they are out.</p><h3>5. Dance-off</h3><p class=align-left>Dance off is among the most fun girl night games that will put the group's heart rate through the roof. The girls are divided into two groups, and one must be the judge. Each group is given a few minutes to practice a routine or freestyle. Both groups compete against each and the judge decides the winner.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/e49605c50efc74ff.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>75 fun riddles for teens with answers to get the mind working</span></p></a><h3>6.

The idea is to hide items around the house and communicate the perimeter to the group. You then come up with a list of those items and let the girls find them and bring them to you. Whoever finds the most items in the shortest time wins.</p><h3>7. Just say no</h3><p class=align-left>This is a guesswork game where the girls choose a character and using a yes or no answer they try to guess each other's character. When one thinks they know their opponent's character they say it aloud. If they are wrong, they are out and if they are right they gain a point.</p><h3>8. Who is most likely to...</h3><p class=align-left>'Who is most likely to' is one of the most hilarious party games for ladies. You start by writing down cards with <a href=#>various questions</a> and then the group is asked who is most likely to do what the question asks. For example, "Who is most likely to take too long in the bathroom?". Everyone must point to the person who fits the brief. Whoever gets the most votes takes the card. In the end, you will find out how well you really know each other.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/85671e7d1d41278d.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>30 cute couple games to play to make your evenings more fun</span></p></a><h3>9.

These questions are great for the girls to bond with each other.</p><h3>13. Guess the tune</h3><p class=align-left>This game is a good icebreaker game for ladies' night that is best played in a controlled environment. One person becomes the DJ and chooses random bits of different songs. The goal is to give the rest a hint of what song they are singing. The first person to guess the most songs correctly wins!</p><h3>14. If you know what I mean</h3><p class=align-left>This game works well if people have dirty minds. Everyone must start by imagining a situation like "you are in a forest", then everyone takes turns exchanging sentences that end up with "if you know what I mean", with a fun or sexual word. Make it as raunchy as possible to spice it up. The first person to run out of these phrases is out! This goes on till the last person wins the game.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/f50dd102a65997da.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>53 things to do with your boyfriend: fun ways to spend time together</span></p></a><h3>15.

The rule here is that the <a id=https://www.legit.ng/1227348-top-25-managerial-interview-questions-sample-answers.html href=#>questions being asked</a> are about relationships. If one is uncomfortable answering then they must take a shot and if they answer then the person asking must take a shot.</p><h3>17. Never have I ever</h3><p class=align-left>This game is also known as ten fingers which starts with one person in the group saying what they have never done.

This is one of the best girls' night drinking games you should play.</p><h3>19. Karaoke shot</h3><p class=align-left>Who doesn't like karaoke and alcohol? Ladies will start by taking shots before taking to the stage for the karaoke. They will keep taking shots and each must perform a specific song without making mistakes. One is disqualified if they omit words until the last lady is left standing.</p><h3>20.

She’s the woman who <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>pelted Simon Cowell with eggs </a>at a live show in 2013. Natalie emerged from the orchestra pit with a carton of eggs during <strong><a href=#>Richard and Adam Johnson’s </a>opera act</strong>. Cowell was covered in eggs by the end of the performance and Holt later <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">issued an apology</a> for interrupting Richard and Adam (although she did not apologize for the egg-throwing.)</strong></p><p>Natalie’s career has actually taken off since the big televised incident. She now serves as the composer on the new Disney+ show Loki. The six-episode series drops an episode every Wednesday on the streaming platform featuring Natalie’s musical stylings.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-natalie-holt-composes-music-for-loki-after-simon-cowell-egg-throwing-incident>Natalie Holt Composes Music For ‘Loki’ After Simon Cowell Egg Throwing Incident</h2><p>Natalie had previously auditioned for <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Britain’s Got Talent</a> with her group RaVen Quartet. During the audition, producers apparently told the group to mime playing while a track actually played the music. Cowell also played a part in turning the group away and she decided to take a stand.</p><p>“I basically took a stand against people miming on television and against Simon and his dreadful influence on the<br>music industry,” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">she said after the incident.</a></p><p>loading="lazy"</p><p>Though it seemed like Natalie’s career might be hindered by her egg throwing, it actually had the opposite effect. She worked on the historical drama Knightfall&nbsp;in its second season in 2019 before the show was canceled. The Emmy nominee also worked on the Amazon Prime film Herself, and Paddington before taking on the task of composing for Loki.</p><p>Fans are loving Natalie’s music compositions especially a couple of violin melodies during emotional moments for Loki throughout the show. Tom Hiddleston’s acting coupled with the musical arrangement gives Marvel fans everything they could have ever imagined from this breakout series. Natalie’s first-ever single from the Loki album <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">was released today</a> on Spotify.</p><p>The first episode of the series had a record-breaking <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">890,000 viewers in one day,</a> which is more than any other Marvel series on Disney+ so far. YouTube duo Reel Rejects&nbsp;reacted to a video by Eric Voss who pointed out Natalie’s BGT history. Many have agreed that she is a “badass.”</p><p>The YouTubers also discuss some of the big music moments of the show, easter eggs, and give their reactions to the long-awaited premiere. The music adds a great deal of mystery and anticipation to the show which is something that Marvel always executes well. What do you think about the musical composition of Loki?</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/jack-higgins.jpeg alt="‘Britain’s Got Talent’ Dancer Breaks Down After Emotional Routine" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>Britain's Got Talent</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>simon cowell</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK571qikmqZdrLWwedOhqZ6vXZq0qL%2BMmqtmq5mivK95wqiunqScYrSmwNJmq6GdXZy2qHnOn2SaZZyes6bAyKacZqeeYrGqv82esGg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

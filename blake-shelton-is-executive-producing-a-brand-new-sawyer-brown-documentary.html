Back in their era, the group has charted country No. 1s as&nbsp; “Step That Step,” “Some Girls Do” and “Thank God for You.” Now, as they celebrate 40 years in the country music scene, <a href=#>Shel</a><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">t</a><a href=#>on</a> believes their story deserves to be known.</p><p>“Sawyer Brown defined ’90s country,” he said in the trailer of the documentary.</p><p>Sawyer Brown’s inspiring journey will be told in Get Me to the Stage on Time. In this Shelton-produced documentary, the film examines how the group embedded its name on the industry.</p><p>The “No Body” singer previously confessed his love and admiration for Sawyer Brown. According to him, the first concert he ever attended was by the band. Furthermore, the first singles that he purchased was Sawyer Brown’s cover of George Jones’ “The Race Is On.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>Get Me to the Stage on Time is directed by Madison Miller and Joel Kraus. It will debut on October 1 at the Nashville Film Festive in Franklin, Tennessee.</p><p>“It’s pretty surreal to watch your life and memories and music play out in a film, but Get Me to the Stage On Time does an amazing job of capturing what this ride has been like,” Miller <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said</a>. “I think the film shows not only what it took to get our career going, but also what it took to keep the wheels from coming off a couple of times.”</p><p>Sawyer Brown kicked off an unprecedented music career when they won Star Search in 1983. Such was an era before The Voice and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">American Idol</a> became the idea platform to launch a promising career in the world of entertainment.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-his-wife-gwen-stefani-confesses-she-misses-him-so-bad-on-the-voice>His Wife Gwen Stefani Confesses She Misses Him “So Bad” on The Voice</h2><p>Following Shelton’s departure from <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Voice</a>, his wife Gwen Stefani, who is coming back for season 24, admitted that she misses him on the series. Nonetheless, she said that his absence didn’t become hard to deal with, unlike what she expected.</p><p>“It’s really different being on the show without him. I miss him so bad on the show,” she said. “At the same time, it wasn’t as hard as I thought it was going to be because he was just so ready to have a break, it was kind of weighing on me the last season we were on there. I still really love being on the show.”</p><p>Shelton remains to be the coach on the show to ever win nine times. He is followed by Kelly Clarkson, with four wins, and Adam Levine, with three.</p><p>When Stefani joined the series during season seven in 2014, romantic tension became manifest. In 2015, they announced their relationship to the public.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Original_VannaWhite_ABC_Christopher-Willard-220x147.jpg alt="Vanna White Extends Her ‘Wheel Of Fortune’ Contract For Two More Years" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57waWYpJ1dqLWmuNOopWaho2KyubHCrquirpVivbO7w66aoqaXYq5urtGapZ1lnprEbr%2FAsLCeql2Xv7DDzWabqJulorKvwMCrsGg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

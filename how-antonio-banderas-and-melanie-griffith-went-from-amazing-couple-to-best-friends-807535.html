After all, they likely played an important role in your life.
Antonio Banderas and Melanie Griffith are an example of that kind of connection, and that’s why we at Bright Side wanted to share their story with you. A love story, but above all a story of friendship that endures despite everything."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

So&nbsp;I&nbsp;said to&nbsp;Pedro: ’Who is&nbsp;she, who is&nbsp;she, what’s her name,’ and Pedro said to&nbsp;me: ’Antonio, it’s Melanie Griffith.’ And I&nbsp;said, ’That’s it, that’s it. Oh, my&nbsp;God.’”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/267/beb/ecfe8650d094e8b2f0052603ab.jpg><p>6&nbsp;years later, in&nbsp;1995, while they were both starring in&nbsp;the Spanish romantic comedy <i>Two Much,</i> <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>romance</a> knocked at&nbsp;their door. By&nbsp;then, Antonio had already managed to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>appear</a> in&nbsp;big Hollywood productions alongside actors like <a href=# title="Tom Hanks" data-link=tag>Tom Hanks</a>, Meryl Streep, and <a href=# title="Brad Pitt" data-link=tag>Brad Pitt</a>. He&nbsp;had also already been divorced for a&nbsp;while from his ex-wife, Ana Leza. Melanie had also just divorced her second husband, Don Johnson.</p><p>Melanie <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a> about that moment: “I&nbsp;fell in&nbsp;love with Antonio right away. He&nbsp;was a&nbsp;crush.”</p><p>Antonio <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>proposed</a> shortly after they began their relationship on&nbsp;a&nbsp;beach in&nbsp;North Carolina. They married in&nbsp;May 1996 and in&nbsp;September they welcomed their only daughter together, Stella del Carmen.</p><p>Melanie already had two <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>children</a> from her previous marriages, Alexander and Dakota, who became children to&nbsp;Antonio.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ac6/493/fbebda5903acc4a4908874c08d.jpg><p>Their <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>marriage</a> lasted 18&nbsp;years and ended by&nbsp;mutual agreement in&nbsp;2014, to&nbsp;the surprise of&nbsp;most of&nbsp;the couple’s followers. They put an&nbsp;end to&nbsp;a&nbsp;part of&nbsp;their life that was full of&nbsp;intensity and complicity. However, their friendship and <a href=# title=family data-link=tag>family</a> relationship will go&nbsp;on&nbsp;forever.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c58/13f/218b0b54b287c1cf623b939c26.jpg><p>The Spanish actor mentioned the good relationship that bring them together despite their divorce. In&nbsp;one interview, he&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a>: “I&nbsp;remember those years as&nbsp;a&nbsp;very effervescent and beautiful time. I&nbsp;am no&nbsp;longer married to&nbsp;Melanie, but she is&nbsp;my&nbsp;family. She’s probably one of&nbsp;my&nbsp;best friends, if&nbsp;not the best. My&nbsp;family is&nbsp;there: Dakota, little Stella and Alexander.”</p><p>Melanie has also made it&nbsp;more than clear that love and admiration are common in&nbsp;their relationship. On&nbsp;social media, she can’t stop supporting Antonio and at&nbsp;the same time remembering the time they got to&nbsp;spend together.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c0f/047/935a6150328fa56649e6cf1dba.jpg><p>“Happy Birthday to&nbsp;my&nbsp;ruggedly handsome ex-husband Antonio! I&nbsp;will always love you,” she wrote in&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>post</a>. She also <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>posted</a>: “CONGRATULATIONS ANTONIO!!! Academy Award Nomination for Best Actor!! I&nbsp;am so&nbsp;happy for you and so&nbsp;proud of&nbsp;you!! Bravo Guapo!!!”</p><p>With these statements, the well-known actors publicly and openly demonstrate that the end of&nbsp;their marriage did not put an&nbsp;end to&nbsp;their good relationship, and neither did that of&nbsp;Melanie’s children with Antonio. This is&nbsp;how <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Dakota</a> put&nbsp;it: “My&nbsp;stepfather, Antonio Banderas, burst into our lives. He&nbsp;was so&nbsp;vibrant and so&nbsp;funny, and his English was... abstract. And we&nbsp;found it&nbsp;absolutely amazing. He&nbsp;loved my&nbsp;mother and my&nbsp;siblings and I&nbsp;so fiercely, so&nbsp;big and so&nbsp;loud that it&nbsp;would change all of&nbsp;our lives forever.”</p><p>Melanie and Antonio had a&nbsp;marriage with its ups and downs (like everyone else), they enjoyed their time together and knew how to&nbsp;live their love to&nbsp;the fullest. But they also knew when it&nbsp;was time to&nbsp;go&nbsp;their separate ways without losing the great love they have for each other.</p><p>These two actors are the living proof that it&nbsp;is&nbsp;possible to&nbsp;maintain a&nbsp;good relationship with the ex-spouse, keep the respect and even become great friends and confidants.</p><p>How is&nbsp;your relationship with your ex-partner? Do&nbsp;you think it&nbsp;is&nbsp;possible to&nbsp;have a&nbsp;good relationship with an&nbsp;ex?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLWww4yapa2nnp68bq7Ap5ueqpGoeqK6w2aknqSRo7amecaroJ%2Bemam1bsPEp6tmnqKkum6tzJqxoqaXYrCwwc%2BlnGasn2Kvpr%2FTZp2roZWjsbR5l2lubmtlZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

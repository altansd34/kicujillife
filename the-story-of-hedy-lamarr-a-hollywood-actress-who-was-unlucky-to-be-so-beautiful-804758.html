Her parents were educated, intelligent people of&nbsp;Jewish origin. Her father was a&nbsp;bank director, and her mom was a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>pianist</a>. From an&nbsp;early age, Lamarr showed interest in&nbsp;theater and cinema and was learning the piano and ballet.</p><p><br>In&nbsp;1933, the Lamarr was noticed on&nbsp;the stage of&nbsp;a&nbsp;Vienna theatre by&nbsp;the richest man in&nbsp;Austria, Friedrich Mandl. He&nbsp;was so&nbsp;persistent that the young woman agreed to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>marry</a> him despite the disapproval of&nbsp;her parents. And this was a&nbsp;mistake.</p><p><h2>Under the tyranny of&nbsp;a&nbsp;jealous husband</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/182/c0f/8954cb5fbfa56c28c118cc45e2.jpg><p>The <a href=# title=marriage data-link=tag>marriage</a> became a&nbsp;cage for Lamarr and it&nbsp;wasn’t even gold. The jealous husband forbade her to&nbsp;act in&nbsp;movies, spied on&nbsp;and listened to&nbsp;her phone calls, and kept her locked away. He&nbsp;only let her go&nbsp;out escorted by&nbsp;a&nbsp;maid and allocated very poor funds for her life. Even the actress’s jewelry was locked in&nbsp;the safe. The thought that someone else would see his wife in&nbsp;movies worried him so&nbsp;much that he&nbsp;started a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>hunt</a> for each copy of&nbsp;any film that had her in&nbsp;it.</p><p>Eventually, Lamarr gave up&nbsp;and decided to&nbsp;escape. At&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the parties her jealous husband paraded her around to&nbsp;show to&nbsp;others, she asked a&nbsp;British officer for help. He&nbsp;agreed. The actress was packing her suitcases when her husband suddenly came&nbsp;in. He&nbsp;turned on&nbsp;the vinyl disc recorder and Lamarr heard her own voice begging the officer to&nbsp;help her escape. <strong>As&nbsp;it&nbsp;turned out, Mandl had been secretly listening to&nbsp;her in&nbsp;the dining room as&nbsp;well.</strong></p><p>That’s when the girl went to&nbsp;extremes&nbsp;— she put on&nbsp;her maid’s uniform and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>sewed in</a>&nbsp;all the jewelry she could manage. She then <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>escaped</a> to&nbsp;<a href=# title=London data-link=tag>London</a>.</p><p><h2>To&nbsp;the stars, through hardships and adventures</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5ac/d6b/3797a7535899155d1f780d7790.jpg><p>Hedy Lamarr and Louis Mayer, the president of&nbsp;Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer</p><p>Things started to&nbsp;go&nbsp;well for Lamarr, as&nbsp;the head of&nbsp;Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Louis Mayer, was also in&nbsp;London when she was there. Lamarr arranged a&nbsp;meeting with him with the help of&nbsp;an&nbsp;agent of&nbsp;the studio who was in&nbsp;charge of&nbsp;talent searching. Mayer offered her a&nbsp;contract for 6&nbsp;months with a&nbsp;payment of&nbsp;$125&nbsp;a week. She refused because <strong>she knew that her talent was worth more.</strong></p><p>But when he&nbsp;left, Lamarr realized she made a&nbsp;mistake because it&nbsp;was a&nbsp;good chance to&nbsp;become a&nbsp;Hollywood star. But it&nbsp;was too late&nbsp;— Mayer was going on&nbsp;a&nbsp;cruise trip back to&nbsp;the United States and all the tickets for this trip were sold out. Lamarr decided to&nbsp;go&nbsp;to&nbsp;extremes again and snuck onboard, presenting herself as&nbsp;a&nbsp;babysitter of&nbsp;a&nbsp;14-year-old passenger. Mayer was so&nbsp;impressed by&nbsp;the actress’s boldness and the reaction her beauty caused on&nbsp;the cruise ship that he&nbsp;pondered again and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>offered</a> her a&nbsp;contract for 7&nbsp;years with a&nbsp;weekly payment of&nbsp;$550.</p><p><h2>The birth of&nbsp;a&nbsp;Hollywood diva</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/6af/f7e/6809f05c02bf5faedfcc33e198.jpg><p>Mayer offered the girl to&nbsp;take on&nbsp;the stage name, Hedy Lamarr, in&nbsp;honor of&nbsp;the silent film actress, Barbara La&nbsp;Marr, that his wife admired. He&nbsp;gave her one of&nbsp;the main roles in&nbsp;<i>Algiers </i>(1938) and started to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>promote</a> the unknown actress to&nbsp;audiences as&nbsp;a&nbsp;very popular Austrian actress and “the most beautiful woman in&nbsp;the world.” And he&nbsp;wasn’t mistaken&nbsp;— when people anxiously visited the cinema to&nbsp;see her on-screen, they were astonished. <strong>The beauty of&nbsp;Hedy Lamarr took their breath away.</strong></p><p>Starting from this moment, Lamarr took on&nbsp;the image of&nbsp;a&nbsp;gorgeous beauty of&nbsp;exotic origin. She earned great success thanks to&nbsp;her role of&nbsp;Delilah in&nbsp;<i>Samson and Delilah</i> (1949). Though she starred together with many popular actors of&nbsp;that time, such as&nbsp;Clark Gable, Judy Garland, and Charles Boyer, most of&nbsp;her characters had very few lines. Her developed brain was suffering from a&nbsp;lack of&nbsp;stimulation. And while the on-screen actress was surrounded by&nbsp;men’s attention, the real Hedy Lamarr was <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>exhausted</a> by&nbsp;boredom, loneliness, and home-sickness.</p><p><h2>The hidden passion of&nbsp;Hedy Lamarr</h2></p><p>As&nbsp;a&nbsp;child, Lamarr avidly listened to&nbsp;her father’s stories about how things <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>worked</a>. At&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;5, she disassembled and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>assembled</a> a&nbsp;music box. Later, her inquiring mind absorbed all the information she heard from scientists at&nbsp;meetings organized by&nbsp;her first husband, Friedrich Mandl. While taking a&nbsp;rest from acting in&nbsp;her <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>trailer</a>, she made some real discoveries.</p><p>And once, at&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the gala dinners<strong> in&nbsp;1940, Lamarr met a&nbsp;man who shared her passion. </strong>Together with the composer George Antheil, they developed the idea for a&nbsp;device that they <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>patented</a> as&nbsp;a&nbsp;“secret communication device.” But, apparently, they were too ahead of&nbsp;their time, as&nbsp;the idea was rejected. But decades later, based on&nbsp;the original concept of&nbsp;Lamarr and Antheil, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth were developed.</p><p><h2>Snow White with Einstein’s brain</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/905/050/1e940350b892c712410c6daf03.jpg><p>Hedy Lamarr had 6&nbsp;husbands and many lovers. Her last husband was her <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>divorce lawyer</a>. After divorcing him, Lamarr didn’t get married again. And the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>woman</a> <strong>whose charming face inspired Disney artists to&nbsp;create the image of&nbsp;Snow White </strong>lived in&nbsp;loneliness her last 35&nbsp;years.</p><p>In&nbsp;the ’60s, when her beauty started to&nbsp;fade, Hollywood no&nbsp;longer needed her, and her career began to&nbsp;decline. As&nbsp;a&nbsp;result, Lamarr lived on&nbsp;a&nbsp;tiny <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>retirement</a> payment of&nbsp;just $48&nbsp;a week.</p><p>Only in&nbsp;1997 did she receive an&nbsp;award for her invention, but no&nbsp;monetary reward followed. However, well into the end of&nbsp;her life, Lamarr continued to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>create</a> things, like a&nbsp;fluorescent collar, a&nbsp;new type of&nbsp;traffic light, and modifications for a&nbsp;supersonic liner. However, these inventions remained useless to&nbsp;people.</p><p><h2>Bonus</h2></p><p>Hedy Lamarr’s life resembled an&nbsp;adventurous movie, and there is&nbsp;one more fact we&nbsp;would like to&nbsp;mention. Once, the actress was taking part in&nbsp;a&nbsp;fundraising activity where <strong>she would kiss anyone who donated $25,000.</strong> Eventually, people say she had to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>kiss</a> 680 people and collected $17&nbsp;million. However, it’s likely that she was everywhere kissing the same man, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>sailor</a> Eddie Rhodes, who was traveling with her to&nbsp;raise funds across the country and would hide in&nbsp;the crowd before each performance.</p><p>Therefore, the life of&nbsp;Hedy Lamarr has been overgrown with legends and speculations over time. It&nbsp;has been <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>announced</a> that a&nbsp;new series based on&nbsp;the actress’ life, starring Gal Gadot, is&nbsp;going to&nbsp;be&nbsp;filmed soon. We&nbsp;are looking forward to&nbsp;seeing&nbsp;it, and we&nbsp;hope you are too.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ce2/a5f/4c8ea95cc794d39c05ed053bdc.jpg><p>Have you or&nbsp;any of&nbsp;your friends ever been treated differently due to&nbsp;your appearance?

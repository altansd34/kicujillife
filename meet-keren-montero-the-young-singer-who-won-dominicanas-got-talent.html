Ever since she was a child, Montero always sang for a local church choir, and that’s where she developed a love for singing.</p><p>“The church was my first stage and it has been my platform and it continues to be until now,” Montero said. “One day they decided to give me an opportunity in the church, and I was excited and very nervous.”</p><p>Apart from being active in the church, Montero is also a member of an organization that helps the youth through music. Montero collaborates with the Voy a Ser Grande foundation, led by Tony López, and a team of young people, talent builders, who have joined forces to make the ambitions of youth with few means come true.</p><p>She is thankful to God for her talented voice that has a touch of gospel and soul but also the power to hit the high notes. The combination of technique and natural ability has helped her stand out from the rest of the competition. Her skills have led to her gaining the Golden Buzzer and winning DGT, and now she is looking to do the same on <a href=#>AGT All Stars</a>.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-she-is-a-golden-buzzer-receiver-on-dgt>She is a Golden Buzzer Receiver on DGT</h2><p>The second season of&nbsp;DGT came to an end and saw the aspiring <a href=# class=broken_link>young singer</a>, Montero become the winner of the competition. Before getting the prize on the season finale, Montero managed to earn herself the Golden Buzzer during her audition.</p><p>While singing “Rise Up,” by Andra Day on her audition, DGT judge Nashla Bogaert was wowed enough to award Montero with her Golden Buzzer. The special award took her directly to the semifinals of the contest and she was the first participant to do so.</p><p>The judge admires her vocals and she even admits that from the first note of the song, she is certain Montero was deserving of the Golden Buzzer. Montero faces tough competition on AGT All Stars and if she wants to wow the judges once again, she will need to step up her game.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Original_MikeEWinfield_Trae-PattonNBC-220x147.jpg alt="Take a Look Back on Mike E.

Some squirrels are running up&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a href=# title=tree data-link=tag>tree</a> over there! But suddenly, something unexpected happens. You notice something weird in&nbsp;the distance in&nbsp;between the trees, <a href=# title=it data-link=tag>it</a>&nbsp;kinda looks like a&nbsp;concrete structure of&nbsp;some sort! Weird...</p><p>At&nbsp;this point, you’re at&nbsp;least <strong>20&nbsp;miles</strong> deep into the <a href=# title=woods data-link=tag>woods</a> and there are no&nbsp;nearby towns or&nbsp;villages...as far as&nbsp;you know. So, you decide to&nbsp;go&nbsp;off the trail with your <a href=# title=friends data-link=tag>friends</a> to&nbsp;get a&nbsp;closer look. But as&nbsp;you get nearer you realize that it’s actually a&nbsp;12-foot-tall staircase, and it’s leading&nbsp;to... Nowhere? Hmm. What’s it&nbsp;doing there, in&nbsp;the middle of&nbsp;literally nowhere? And it&nbsp;doesn’t even lead to&nbsp;anything.</p><p>You put on&nbsp;your <a href=# title="Sherlock Holmes" data-link=tag>Sherlock Holmes</a> cap and investigate. So...maybe there used to&nbsp;be&nbsp;an&nbsp;old house or&nbsp;mansion here that collapsed over the years and the only thing left is&nbsp;this staircase? But weirdly enough, after circling the bizarre structure you realize there’s no&nbsp;trace of&nbsp;any ruins or&nbsp;even foundations! It’s like someone just sliced a&nbsp;staircase off their house, cake style, and plopped it&nbsp;here, for no&nbsp;reason. Ok...</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/6f6/25e/7878685087bc934d75ec663817.png><p>You and your friends aren’t really into getting a&nbsp;whole lot closer. Something feels wrong... the longer you look at&nbsp;this weird structure, the more you feel a&nbsp;super creepy presence... something tells you you should probably leave the area, as&nbsp;fast as&nbsp;possible. You can’t explain the feeling, or&nbsp;take your eyes off the creepy staircase. You take out your phone and snap some pictures.</p><p>Then, after a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;hesitation, you take a&nbsp;few steps closer and notice that the stairs don’t seem to&nbsp;be&nbsp;all that ancient, a&nbsp;few decades old at&nbsp;best. There’s moss growing out from some cracks. Your friends have had enough. They ditch you and run off back to&nbsp;the trail, leaving you alone on&nbsp;the staircase. You put your foot carefully on&nbsp;the first step. Wham! Adrenaline rush.</p><p>As&nbsp;you ascend to&nbsp;the top, someone touches your shoulder. You jump and turn around. All you see is&nbsp;black. As&nbsp;weird as&nbsp;this sounds, discoveries of&nbsp;random staircases, illogically found in&nbsp;the woods, are surprisingly common! Some are made of&nbsp;wood, others of&nbsp;bricks or&nbsp;stones. Some look ancient while others...look like they were finished yesterday! The one thing they all have in&nbsp;common... they all lead to&nbsp;absolutely nowhere, and they’re all found in&nbsp;super-mysterious locations!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/c55/2cd/94712e53f0a20eca0a77d98e5f.png><p>One of&nbsp;the most famous ones is&nbsp;in&nbsp;Chesterfield, New Hampshire. A&nbsp;long medieval looking staircase made of&nbsp;stones with roman arches in&nbsp;the middle of&nbsp;the woods. It’s believed to&nbsp;have been part of&nbsp;Madame Antoinette Sherri’s Castle. She was a&nbsp;big singer back in&nbsp;<a href=# title=Paris data-link=tag>Paris</a>. The castle dates back about 100&nbsp;years... and it&nbsp;was later discovered again in&nbsp;1962. This time, there was nothing but a&nbsp;staircase.</p><p>Another mysterious ancient staircase dates back to&nbsp;9,000 years ago. It’s in&nbsp;a&nbsp;forest in&nbsp;Italy. It&nbsp;looks like a&nbsp;series of&nbsp;stairs that lead to&nbsp;a&nbsp;tiny platform at&nbsp;the top. Why go&nbsp;through all the trouble of&nbsp;building the thing if&nbsp;it&nbsp;leads to...nowhere? Well, some experts think it&nbsp;could have been some sort of&nbsp;ritual tower, but your guess is&nbsp;as&nbsp;good as&nbsp;theirs.</p><p>Some of&nbsp;the more modern staircases found in&nbsp;the woods also have an&nbsp;added bonus: they come with their own urban legends! Gee, would that be&nbsp;a&nbsp;two story or&nbsp;three story staircase? Ha&nbsp;ha. One of&nbsp;the most popular stories comes from the <a href=# title=Philippines data-link=tag>Philippines</a>, where a&nbsp;forest ranger called Torkik allegedly went out on&nbsp;one of&nbsp;his routine patrols to&nbsp;look for missing people deep in&nbsp;the local jungle. That’s where he&nbsp;claims he&nbsp;found some seriously out of&nbsp;place stone staircases. They even had weird markings on&nbsp;them!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/979/6e5/c50f0c532e963327b21b9e9e5e.png><p>To&nbsp;get a&nbsp;better look at&nbsp;what was around him, he&nbsp;decided to&nbsp;climb up&nbsp;one of&nbsp;them. Just then, he&nbsp;was approached by&nbsp;a&nbsp;vicious stray dog, that forced him further up&nbsp;the stairs. A&nbsp;few hours later he&nbsp;came back to&nbsp;the village. Only thing was, he&nbsp;had been missing or&nbsp;5&nbsp;years! Was that staircase a&nbsp;time traveling portal? Hmmm.</p><p>Another account allegedly dates back to&nbsp;the 1940s, around the time of&nbsp;the Roswell UFO mystery. A&nbsp;man who claimed to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;disease scientist was sent to&nbsp;assist in&nbsp;investigating one of&nbsp;the many animal related cases that kept popping&nbsp;up. Little did he&nbsp;know, this 1&nbsp;to&nbsp;2&nbsp;week investigation would end up&nbsp;lasting 6&nbsp;months! His team encountered a&nbsp;random wooden staircase in&nbsp;the woods that seemed to&nbsp;emit some type of&nbsp;frequency. They camped around 100 feet [100&nbsp;ft 30&nbsp;m] from it&nbsp;that night, but the next morning...it vanished.</p><p>All that was left was a&nbsp;black burn mark where the staircase was! 2&nbsp;days later, it&nbsp;reappeared out of&nbsp;nowhere, 160 feet [160&nbsp;ft 48&nbsp;m] from its original location! The team wanted to&nbsp;get a&nbsp;sample of&nbsp;the wood to&nbsp;send off to&nbsp;the lab. There was one problem. No&nbsp;matter how hard they tried, it&nbsp;was impossible to&nbsp;chip off a&nbsp;piece, the wood from the staircase was apparently indestructible!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/63a/44a/4b7ea55edea3050b91b1347173.png><p>These weird mystery-stairs have been around since ancient Cambodia. Right in&nbsp;the middle of&nbsp;the jungle, is&nbsp;an&nbsp;abandoned 2000-foot-long staircase leading&nbsp;to... yup, nowhere. According to&nbsp;experts, this staircase was built about a&nbsp;thousand years ago. They don’t know for sure, but they think it&nbsp;led to&nbsp;an&nbsp;ancient city. Sadly, over the years, that city is&nbsp;now completely covered by&nbsp;the dense jungle. Maybe it&nbsp;was an&nbsp;important meeting spot for travelers and merchants coming from all over the continent!</p><p>Well, back to&nbsp;your story. You feel a&nbsp;strange presence behind you. You turn around, probably one of&nbsp;your friends snuck up&nbsp;on&nbsp;you or&nbsp;something...but then you realize there was no&nbsp;one behind you, you’re the only one around. You freak out. Something is&nbsp;definitely wrong here, so&nbsp;you rush down the stairs, and bolt back to&nbsp;your friends, panting and startled.</p><p>You start to&nbsp;tell your friends what happened, but they don’t believe you. They think you’re just trying to&nbsp;scare them even more. But the emotion on&nbsp;your face... it&nbsp;looks legit. There’s real panic in&nbsp;your eyes, the kind you just can’t fake. Shadow or&nbsp;wind or&nbsp;whatever that thing was, your fear’s real.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/908/49e/a88e9e5d23852d7e4368f0f9a6.png><p>You all agree that you should stay away from the stairs, and it’s probably best if&nbsp;you go&nbsp;back home. Right now. I&nbsp;guess camping out there overnight just wasn’t meant to&nbsp;be. As&nbsp;soon as&nbsp;you get home, you open your phone and check out your gallery. But... no&nbsp;you scroll through photo after photo. The staircase. It&nbsp;isn’t there!</p><p>None of&nbsp;the pictures have any staircases in&nbsp;them... Just a&nbsp;small flat clearing with nothing but trees around, no&nbsp;weird shadows, nothing. Your friends have the same experience. Your eye twitches and you look over your left shoulder... you’re in&nbsp;the safety of&nbsp;your own home, but you suddenly feel the same presence you felt on&nbsp;that staircase. Oh, no... Everything goes black.</p><p>But you can relax, most of&nbsp;these stories are just urban legends, told to&nbsp;give you the heebie-jeebies! (Which is&nbsp;a&nbsp;variant of&nbsp;the Cooties virus.) The internet has a&nbsp;way of&nbsp;spreading rumors, faster than the speed of&nbsp;light! Most of&nbsp;these stairs might’ve even been built on&nbsp;purpose, just recently. One weekend wood-shop project, a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;photos, and you too could be&nbsp;a&nbsp;sensation on&nbsp;every urban legend website! Then you just tear it&nbsp;down, take a&nbsp;photo to&nbsp;show it&nbsp;magically disappeared, and just like that, you’re an&nbsp;internet super-star!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/b27/512/e9dd93520bb327eac2bb40e97e.png><p>But let’s say you find some real stairs on&nbsp;your weekend camping trip... They’re most likely the remnants from an&nbsp;old house or&nbsp;a&nbsp;cabin that got demolished or&nbsp;just collapsed after it&nbsp;was abandoned. Hey, it’s 2021, there’s a&nbsp;logical explanation for just about everything these days! That presence you felt was most likely your own mind playing tricks on&nbsp;you.</p><p>When you see something in&nbsp;real life that looks like something you saw on&nbsp;a&nbsp;website or&nbsp;a&nbsp;scary movie, your mind starts to&nbsp;work overtime, and you can actually see something or&nbsp;feel something that’s not even there. That’s what some people say happens when you get hypnotized... you want to&nbsp;see something so&nbsp;bad... and you&nbsp;do. That’s probably what happened. Or&nbsp;was&nbsp;it...</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZMSpxYyamZqmlKS7prCMrKuaoaKoeqyxxKlkmqigmq6ztc2gZKKmXay8sLDSZqmappSkuq3FjHFobHBpbXw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

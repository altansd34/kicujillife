The&nbsp;1993 Miss USA winner</strong> <strong>is an expert in providing the shadiest clap backs. Whichever professional dancer she is partnered with will have their work cut out for them.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-latest-dancing-with-the-stars-casting-rumor-involves-a-longtime-housewife>The Latest ‘Dancing With the Stars’ Casting Rumor Involves a Longtime Housewife</h2><p>Moore is <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">known for twirling</a>, her signature move that has gone on to become synonymous with her on-camera persona. Fans are going to be absolutely devastated if twirling is not incorporated into her Dancing with the Stars routines. It was initially speculated that The Real Housewives of New York City star Luann de Lesseps would be competing.</p><p>The fact that any stars of The Real Housewives franchise are even being considered for Dancing with the Stars might be a shock altogether. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">OK! Magazine</a> reported in 2020 that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Tyra Banks</a> allegedly “didn’t want any more Housewives in her ballroom.” A source went on to claim that the Housewives do not make headlines enough for Banks to want to cast them on the show. Bethenny Frankel <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">slammed Banks on Twitter</a> for reportedly banning Housewives from the show.</p><p>“Good to know @tyrabanks has clumped me in her no more housewives mandate on @DancingABC Also good to know – their casting director Deena, who I (heart emoji) has asked me to be on that show multiple x in the last decade. I’m also no longer a housewife, but nobody is bigger than the game Tyra,” Frankel wrote.</p><p>A rep for Banks later said that the rumor about Banks banning Housewives is “100 percent untrue.” Banks is reportedly a huge fan of the franchise. Quite a few Housewives have joined Dancing with the Stars over the years. Some of them found more success than others after strapping on their dancing shoes. Let’s rank The Real Housewives stars on their dancing skills from best to worst.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-ranking-all-of-the-real-housewives-stars-that-have-competed-on-dancing-with-the-stars>Ranking All of ‘The Real Housewives’ Stars That Have Competed on ‘Dancing With the Stars’</h2><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-1-lisa-rinna>1. Lisa Rinna</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>This might be controversial, but Lisa Rinna killed it on Season 2 of Dancing with the Stars. She was shockingly eliminated just ahead of the finale which sent fans into a tailspin. Viewers fell in love with her spunky personality and dream partnership with Louis Van Amstel. Every dance they performed together was full of chemistry. Rinna very rarely missed steps and looked like a total pro on the dance floor. She is the best of the best in our book. Do you agree?</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-2-joanna-krupa>2. Joanna Krupa</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>The Real Housewives of Miami star Joanna Krupa actually competed on Season 9 of Dancing with the Stars before becoming a Housewife. Her dance routines were so awesome and consistent that we obviously had to put her high in the rankings. Krupa also missed out on the finale with her partner <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Derek Hough</a> after weeks of dynamic routines. Their salsa still goes down in history as one of the best the show has ever seen. Yellow fringe has never looked so good.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-3-erika-jayne>3. Erika Jayne</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://youtu.be/KXeoDfaGXME</p></figure><p>Erika Jayne’s life has been flipped upside down with a lot of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">legal troubles</a> right now, but she is an extremely talented performer. What made Jayne stand out so much on Season 24 of Dancing with the Stars is that she had so much confidence. She knew that she was not the best technical dancer. She still had a lot of faith in her flexibility and her sassy delivery of the dance moves. Dancing to her own song “XXPEN$IVE” was a boss move, especially when dancing next to the perfect specimen that is <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Gleb Savchenko</a>.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-4-kim-fields>4. Kim Fields</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://youtu.be/CAlZx09Qpx4</p></figure><p>Kim Fields is yet another Real Housewives star that was eliminated way too early when she competed on Season 22. Fields had a great enthusiasm about every dance that she performed. She kept a smile on her face throughout each dance and was never afraid to dance full-out. Sasha Farber was the perfect partner for her because their energies matches each other so well.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-5-nene-leakes>5. NeNe Leakes</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>NeNe Leakes gave her time on Season 18 of Dancing with the Stars everything that she had. Her facial expressions during the dances deserve an award on their own. Fans didn’t care if Leakes nailed the ballroom moves perfectly. They really just wanted to see her have fun and she did exactly that. Fierce isn’t even the right word to describe the Cha-Cha-Cha that she performed with Tony Dovolani in the first week.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-6-denise-richards>6. Denise Richards</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://youtu.be/6m7U1kEgpFM</p></figure><p>Like Kruppa, Denise Richards competed on Dancing with the Stars before she became a Housewife. Richards was the source of drama during Season 10 of The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills. Brandi Glanville <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">alleged they had an affair</a> and it made headlines for months. Richards only performed three dances on the show in 2009 before she was eliminated. She really didn’t get a fair chance and her moves weren’t all that bad.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-7-lisa-vanderpump>7. Lisa Vanderpump</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>Lisa Vanderpump is absolutely iconic for her time on The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills. Unfortunately, her dancing skills just didn’t measure up. Season 16 of Dancing with the Stars was full of stiff competition. Vanderpump was a joy to watch because of her vibrant personality. Her dancing did not pack the same punch that her competitors Zendaya and Kellie Pickler did. She needed to hit the moves harder.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-8-kim-zolciak-biermann>8. Kim Zolciak-Biermann&nbsp;</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>Kim Zolciak-Biermann&nbsp;performed one of the most awkward routines ever in the history of Dancing with the Stars. She looked uncomfortable even just clapping along to the beat of the song. He moves were a little too stiff. At least she kept a smile on her face the whole time and is talented in other areas like throwing shade. She ended up withdrawing from the competition in Week 3 after suffering a mini-stroke.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Ben-Platt-AGT-Americas-Got-Talent-AGT-Results-Show-Dear-Evan-Hansen.jpeg alt="Ben Platt May Have Just Won Season 16 of ‘AGT’ with His Perfect Guest Performance" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>dancing with the stars</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>DWTS</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK570ZqlpKGenHq1tMRmqZ6ZnGK1sMHSnq6irpWoerC6jJ2Yp5uZo7Ruw8itn2asmJp6tMDAq6pmmZ2esW63xKewmmWdpLyzsYycmKysmaO0br7UpqarZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

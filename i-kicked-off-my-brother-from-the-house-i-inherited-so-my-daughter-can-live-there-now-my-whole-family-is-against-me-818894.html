This ended up&nbsp;being me&nbsp;as&nbsp;everyone else was busy with their lives and&nbsp;I had only recently graduated from uni back then. Due to&nbsp;this, when she passed away, I&nbsp;inherited the house she lived&nbsp;in, which is&nbsp;a&nbsp;small 2&nbsp;bedroom. I&nbsp;lived there until&nbsp;I got married, and then&nbsp;I and my&nbsp;husband ended up&nbsp;moving to&nbsp;a&nbsp;bigger property.</p><p>About a&nbsp;year later my&nbsp;brother asked if&nbsp;I was willing to&nbsp;rent it&nbsp;out to&nbsp;him, which&nbsp;I agreed to&nbsp;do, but have warned him&nbsp;I will need it&nbsp;back when Caroline turns&nbsp;18 (she was 3&nbsp;at the time) since it&nbsp;is&nbsp;very close to&nbsp;universities and city center. A&nbsp;legal agreement was drafted for the rent (significantly below market value) so&nbsp;everything was followed by&nbsp;the book.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/901/c9e/6e91bd532fae846e95ff310846.jpg><p>About a&nbsp;year ago&nbsp;I informed my&nbsp;brother about needing the house back as&nbsp;my&nbsp;daughter is&nbsp;going to&nbsp;be&nbsp;18, and&nbsp;I would like to&nbsp;have some repairs done before she moves&nbsp;in. My&nbsp;brother ignored&nbsp;me, so&nbsp;I issued him a&nbsp;notice to&nbsp;vacate, which was also ignored. As&nbsp;he&nbsp;continued to&nbsp;ignore&nbsp;me, I&nbsp;had no&nbsp;choice but to&nbsp;apply for a&nbsp;court order to&nbsp;evict them, with a&nbsp;hearing taking place last month.</p><p>Last week, he&nbsp;and his family were officially evicted. Upon getting into the house, I&nbsp;noticed it&nbsp;was in&nbsp;horrible condition, and it&nbsp;would take a&nbsp;few months just to&nbsp;make it&nbsp;somewhat habitable, let alone do&nbsp;redecorating or&nbsp;repairs.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/21a/c95/27c284570588b012a0828e0a98.jpg><p>I think, I can never earn over which I paid by my precedent employer, but I was wrong, world is so large to try their fate. but now I am making $52/h even more,and easily earn minimum $1300/week, on the experience everyone must try to do work online, easy way to earn, here's an example.</p><p>𝐰𝐰𝐰.Richnow05</p><p>I&nbsp;have raised this with my&nbsp;brother since he&nbsp;was meant to&nbsp;look after the house and let me&nbsp;know of&nbsp;any repairs, but this talk ended up&nbsp;in&nbsp;an&nbsp;argument where&nbsp;I was called a&nbsp;jerk for evicting him and his family so&nbsp;my&nbsp;“spoiled” daughter can live by&nbsp;herself and not giving them enough notice (they had just over a&nbsp;year to&nbsp;find something suitable).</p><p>He&nbsp;also said&nbsp;I had inherited the house by&nbsp;“cheating”.

You gave him notice 14&nbsp;years ago, as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;a&nbsp;1-year reminder notice.<br>You went above and beyond for him, and he’s acting this way, plus calling your daughter spoiled.

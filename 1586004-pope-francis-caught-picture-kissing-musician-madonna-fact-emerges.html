One such objective is the creation of images from scratch following simple instructions.</p><p class=align-left>There are some indications that AI would have generated the image.</p><p class=align-left>A proper check on the image revealed some strange inconsistencies. For example, one of the locks of Madonna's hair appeared to merge with the ear, making the ear look unnatural as it appeared without an earlobe.</p><p class=align-left>Also, the <a href=#>US</a> singer looked quite different in a recent photo from reputable media outlets.</p><p class=align-left>It was also noted that the thumb of the Pope appeared to have melted into the skin of Madonna's breast.</p><p class=align-left>AI generators are known to struggle when creating some parts of the body, particularly the hands and fingers.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/b380f71d3b3b1a01.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Disinformation targeting Brigitte Macron spreads beyond France</span></p></a><h2>Where to confirm AI-generated images</h2><p class=align-left>According to <a href=#>Africa</a> Check, the image was run through five AI image detectors.</p><p class=align-left>The <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Hive Moderator</a> said the image was 99.5 per cent AI-generated. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Is it AI?</a> resulted in a 93.37 per cent possibility.<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> Illuminary</a> said it was 87.9 per cent.

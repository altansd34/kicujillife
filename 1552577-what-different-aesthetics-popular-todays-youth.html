Vaporwave</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/ed00512ffe4c0bf4.png><p class=align-left>Vaporwave is one of the most common aesthetic types today, known for being nostalgic. It usually includes fashion trends that were popular between the 1980s and 1990s. It has marble statues, Kanji, low-quality 3D graphics, and popular apparel brands like Nike, Adidas, and Espirit. The internet culture inspires Vaporwave.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/3c94f40b854d9e99.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Latest George styles: blouses and gowns for traditional marriage</span></p></a><h3>2.

Cottagecore</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/ba568fca1045bb7f.png><p class=align-left>If you love farm life, which is usually slow-paced and rustic, a cottagecore aesthetic would be suitable for you. This fashion style brings out your simplicity and easy way of life in the countryside. It incorporates clothes in natural fabrics with floral prints. Handmade crafts, such as embroidered materials, are also a perfect addition.</p><h3>4. Grunge</h3><p class=align-left>Grunge is sometimes described as carefree and unkempt fashion.

English is spoken by the vast majority of the population, but how many people in the country don’t speak English? Your perception of this depends on where you are. Walk around Little Havana in Miami and you may hear more <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Spanish</a> than English. Stroll through a small town in West Virginia, and you’ll probably be surrounded by English. So, exactly how many people don’t speak English in the US? And what do they speak instead?</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=What-is-the-official-language-in-the-US?>What is the official language in the US?</h2><p>The US, like the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">UK</a>, does not have an <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">official language</a> – at least at the federal level. English is the de facto national language and is spoken at home by a great majority of the population. That said, many states have declared English as their official language, sometimes along with other languages too. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Alaska</a>, for example, has 21 official languages: English, plus 20 Native American languages.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=What-percentage-of-the-US-speaks-English?>What percentage of the US speaks English?</h2><p>According to the latest census data, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">over 91%</a> of people in the US speak English very well. 8.2% of people do not speak English “very well”, though this statistic doesn’t mean that they are completely non-English speakers. It implies that just over 8% of the population is much more comfortable speaking another language, though their level of English probably varies widely. The state of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">West Virginia</a> has one of the highest percentages of people who speak only English at home at 97.7%.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=How-many-people-in-the-US-don’t-speak-English?>How many people in the US don’t speak English?</h2><p>It’s very difficult to know how many people in the US don’t speak English at all. Almost everyone in America speaks at least some English, even if it’s just a few words. In total, almost <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">66 million people</a> speak a language that is not English at home in the US; that’s around 21.6% of the population. Many of these people are bilingual in English and another language.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">13.2%</a> of people in the US speak Spanish at home, which is just over 40 million people, making Spanish the second-most spoken language in the country. The second-most common non-English language spoken at home in America is Chinese, which includes Mandarin and Cantonese, with over <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">three million</a> speakers. In terms of states, in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Nevada</a>, over 30% of the population doesn’t speak English at home – the highest proportion in any US state. Florida comes second with over 28% of people speaking a language other than English at home.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Do-people-still-speak-Native-American-languages?>Do people still speak Native American languages?</h2><p>Yes, despite a history of oppression, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">112</a> Native American languages are still spoken in the US. The most spoken <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Native American languages</a> are <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Navajo</a> and Yupik and Dakota. Navajo is mostly spoken in Arizona and New Mexico, Yupik in Alaska, and Dakota, unsurprisingly, in the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Dakotas</a>. In many communities, the people are bilingual in English and a Native American language, and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">many young people</a> don’t have a great grasp of the indigenous language. It’s estimated that around one-third of Native American languages have become extinct since European colonizers arrived in the area north of Mexico.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Does everyone in the US speak English?</h2><p>No, not everyone in the US speaks English. A little over 8% of the population speaks English less than very well. However, as we said, the level of English-language within this 8% will vary significantly. Nonetheless, with over 91% of the population saying they speak English “very well”, it’s highly likely that if you visit the US, almost everyone you meet will speak English. That means it’s definitely worth brushing up on your <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">English</a> if you’re heading over there. If you’re looking for another language to use widely in the US, you can’t go wrong with <a href=#>Spanish</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.lingoda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Laura-1.jpg><h2>Laura Jones</h2><p>Laura is a freelance writer and was an ESL teacher for eight years.

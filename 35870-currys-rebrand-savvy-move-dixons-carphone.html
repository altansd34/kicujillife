Alex Baldock, the company’s chief executive, describes the move as “the best of the old and the best of the new”. But will consumers feel the same?</p><p>Data from YouGov Ratings may vindicate Dixons Carphone’s decision. Of the group’s four high street shops – Currys, PC World, Carphone Warehouse, and Dixons – Currys is the clear favourite among the British public. Nearly two-thirds of consumers have positive sentiment towards the brand (64%), compared to just 10% who are negatively disposed towards it. With just a quarter expressing a neutral opinion of Currys (24%), it also provokes stronger feelings (either positively or negatively) than its sister retailers.</p><p>Comparatively, while over half express a good opinion of PC World (55%), the public are more likely to have neutral feelings about the high street chain than Currys (35%) – while a similar proportion think negatively of it (9%).</p><p>The group may be happiest to retire the Carphone Warehouse brand. Consumers are as likely to feel neutral towards it (41%) as they are positive (41%) – and they’re considerably more likely to express negative sentiment. Some 16% of the public have a poor opinion of the brand.</p><p>Finally, Dixons – likely a victim of its seven years away from British high streets – has the lowest positive sentiment (37%), the lowest negative sentiment (8%), and by far the highest proportion of people who simply haven’t heard of the retailer at all (15% vs. 2% for Currys and Carphone Warehouse; 1% for PC World). As the Dixons brand was put out to pasture some years ago, it was perhaps an unlikely candidate to lead the reinvented group into its future.</p><p>Baldock described the move as a “bitter sweet day” for Dixons Carphone, which will see well-known brands disappear from hundreds of its nationwide stores. Nevertheless, if the company had to pick a single brand to unite its high street shops under, YouGov data suggests that Currys was the right choice.</p><p paraeid={3776b819-f0df-4a3b-bbf5-fc3b6878ac80}{162} paraid=906725396><strong>Receive monthly topical insights about the retail industry, straight to your inbox. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Sign up today</a>.</strong></p><p paraeid={3776b819-f0df-4a3b-bbf5-fc3b6878ac80}{171} paraid=1274890717><strong>Discover more <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">retail content</a> here</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmixn6q0sMKNnKZnrZtksLC60q6knqpflr%2B1tcKlnKxnY2qFeHyMnKyrqqmoerOxwauYp5xdqK63wthmpKiulWKxqsTOp6pmm5Gnvam7zZ4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

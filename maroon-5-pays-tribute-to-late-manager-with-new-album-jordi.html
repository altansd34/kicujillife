Feldstein, the older brother of actor Jonah Hill, will always have a very special place in <a href=#>Adam Levine’s</a> heart.</strong></p><p>“This album is named after our manager,” Levine wrote on Instagram. “We built this thing together. A piece of me will always be missing. The loss is tragic in ways I’m still learning how to cope with. All I can do is keep him with me and honor him in the best way I know how. I miss him every single day.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-maroon-5-s-album-jordi-is-a-mixed-bag-full-of-hits-a-newer-sound>Maroon 5’s Album ‘Jordi’ is a Mixed Bag Full of Hits, a Newer Sound</h2><p>Jordi features some interesting musical collaborations that are a bit different than the Maroon 5 albums we all grew up with. The title track is the radio hit <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“Beautiful Mistakes”</a> featuring <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Megan Thee Stallion.</a> It’s catchy and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the music video</a> proves that Levine does not age. He performed this song on <a href=#>The Voice</a> this season, leaving many disappointed that Megan did not join him.</p><p>Another song on the album, “Lost,” is a very unique song. It starts off with just a drum beat before launching into a song that almost sounds like it belongs to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Coldplay.</a> The arrangement of the song gives it so much dimension. It makes you want to stick around and listen until the end. Yet another, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“One Light”</a> featuring Bantu, also has very simple lyrics, but is still melodic enough for you to not skip the song.</p><p>The song <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“Remedy”</a> with Stevie Nicks was expected to be one of the highlights of the album. The fact that Nicks does not have her own solo part and just sings along to the chorus is a little disappointing. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“Echo”</a> featuring Blackbear falls a little flat against the stronger collaboration with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>H.E.R.</a> on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“Convince Me Otherwise.”</a></p><p>loading="lazy"</p><br><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-two-songs-with-late-rappers-are-major-highlights-on-the-album>Two Songs with Late Rappers Are Major Highlights on the Album</h2><p>The real highlight of Jordi is the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“Memories Remix”</a> featuring late rapper Nipsey Hussle along with YG. “Memories” serves as a tribute to Feldstein and is all about remembering people you’ve lost and celebrating them. Nipsey was murdered in 2019 in Los Angeles and his posthumous feature on Jordi is equally heartbreaking and a way to honor his memory.</p><p>Late rapper Juice WRLD is featured on the song <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“Can’t Leave You Alone.”</a> He died from an accidental drug overdose in 2019. His verse on the song is very short but is the perfect way to round out Jordi. The song is completely transformed by his feature and makes it feel like more of a radio hit.</p><p>Overall, this album has a few hits and some other misses but makes a couple of things clear. Maroon 5 has well moved past their Songs About Jane era and has moved on to a fusion of soft rock and pop. Regardless of what kind of music they make, fans will always be there to support the band that achieved mainstream success in 2002.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Thumbnail_PhotoBySantiagoFelipe-AdelaLoconte_GettyImages.jpg alt="Nick Lachey Has Hilarious Comeback to Miss Piggy’s ‘Drag Race’ Appearance" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>adam levine</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>maroon 5</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57zJqpqKeeYoJuvMCyqmasop6vtsDEZquoZZyWwaZ5zJqlmp%2BVp3q4tdOhZKedp2Kura7UpmSjp6KZtnA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

Esther decided to stop shaving her body.
In 2018, Esther had a photoshoot wearing a swimsuit.

She used to&nbsp;shave her body hair but felt insecure about the bumps and scars it&nbsp;caused.</p><p>Removing hair was tiring and left her unhappy with her body. She even avoided swimming because of&nbsp;it. In&nbsp;2019, she decided to&nbsp;embrace her natural hairiness and not feel ashamed anymore.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/64a/b36/2b5c0e5a65aba8f749904d87fd.jpg><p>Esther realized that society and the beauty industry pressured women to&nbsp;remove body hair, even though it&nbsp;was a&nbsp;normal part of&nbsp;their bodies. In&nbsp;2022, she challenged herself to&nbsp;go&nbsp;to&nbsp;the beach without removing her body hair. She felt proud and free.</p><p>Over time, she learned to&nbsp;love her body and its hair. Now, she knows that <a href=# title="beauty standards" data-link=tag>beauty standards</a> change, and she can define beauty for herself. Esther’s journey inspires others to&nbsp;love and accept themselves, just as&nbsp;they are.</p><p><h2>Not everyone understands her journey to&nbsp;self acceptance.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b17/b45/f56b6c5e389f6da15a3c7b2964.jpg><p>People have <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>criticized</a> Esther’s decision to&nbsp;not shave her body hair, but she stands strong in&nbsp;her belief. Once, she had a&nbsp;conversation with a&nbsp;guy who told her that women shouldn’t have body hair because it’s unhygienic. In&nbsp;response, she asked him if&nbsp;it&nbsp;was okay for men to&nbsp;have&nbsp;it, which left him silent because he&nbsp;hadn’t considered that perspective before.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/772/cc2/3340865edf9aefa5d88a123850.jpg><p>People’s criticism was also evident when she went to&nbsp;the beach. Despite the stares and judgment, she bravely <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>chose</a> to&nbsp;embrace her natural self. It&nbsp;was her first time going to&nbsp;the beach in&nbsp;a&nbsp;bikini with her hair proudly on&nbsp;display, and she felt a&nbsp;surge of&nbsp;pride within herself.</p><p>As&nbsp;she walked along the shore, she noticed a&nbsp;group of&nbsp;people staring at&nbsp;her, but instead of&nbsp;feeling self-conscious, she mustered the courage to&nbsp;wave at&nbsp;them. At&nbsp;that moment, Esther realized that her journey of&nbsp;self-acceptance had empowered her to&nbsp;be&nbsp;unapologetically herself, regardless of&nbsp;what others thought.</p><p><h2>She is&nbsp;looking for a&nbsp;partner who respects her.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/2b9/5ae/b4f52652c99d9b14a4dc955dc9.jpg><p>Esther looks back on&nbsp;her journey with body hair and feels lucky to&nbsp;have had a&nbsp;supportive partner before embracing her natural self. She shared with them that she was very hairy, and they were totally fine with&nbsp;it.</p><p>“I&nbsp;want to&nbsp;be&nbsp;with someone who isn’t ashamed of&nbsp;walking around with&nbsp;me, and I’ve never been with anyone that was ashamed,” <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>says</a> Esther. She longs for a&nbsp;partner who will proudly be&nbsp;by&nbsp;her side.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/07a/f49/74cff551848ee64d98898a3a74.jpg><p>Recently, Esther had a&nbsp;wonderful experience on&nbsp;a&nbsp;dating program <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>called</a> “Dating Different,” where she had a&nbsp;great time with her date. It&nbsp;showed her that there are people out there who appreciate her for who she truly&nbsp;is, and she remains hopeful in&nbsp;finding a&nbsp;partner who accepts and embraces her uniqueness without judgment.</p><p>Apart from Esther, there are <a href=#>celebrities</a> who have boldly chosen to&nbsp;embrace and take pride in&nbsp;their body hair. These iconic figures have broken away from conventional beauty norms, celebrating their natural selves with confidence and authenticity. From Hollywood stars to&nbsp;renowned musicians, their empowering stories of&nbsp;self-acceptance and <a href=# title="body positivity" data-link=tag>body positivity</a> will inspire you to&nbsp;see beauty in&nbsp;a&nbsp;whole new light.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZMCpsYywmKeso2LBsHnFoqWdZZFivaK%2B06ecq2Wkna61ecispa1lkai1ornEnWSonl2dsrN5waibsmWYlrazeZdqa21vYGQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

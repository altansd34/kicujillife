Stone’s <a href=# title="social media" data-link=tag>social media</a> posts feature her in&nbsp;various everyday moments, capturing her without layers of&nbsp;heavy makeup or&nbsp;glamorous styling.</p><p>Her aim is&nbsp;to&nbsp;remind people that beauty lies in&nbsp;embracing one’s true self, flaws, and all. By&nbsp;sharing these unfiltered glimpses into her life, Stone is&nbsp;challenging society’s unrealistic <a href=# title="beauty standards" data-link=tag>beauty standards</a> and encouraging others to&nbsp;love themselves.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/da7/0b9/563be357bfb318e1ac52dda374.jpg><p>She offers glimpses of&nbsp;her personal moments, allowing her audience to&nbsp;witness her authenticity and vulnerability. From sharing bikini-clad snapshots to&nbsp;showcasing her hobbies like painting, Stone proves that being a&nbsp;Hollywood icon does not require constant perfection or&nbsp;flawless appearances.</p><p>In&nbsp;her social media posts, Stone does not shy away from featuring images where she may not appear conventionally stunning. She embraces her gray hair with pride, celebrating her natural beauty and defying society’s expectations of&nbsp;eternal youth. “I’m so&nbsp;grateful to&nbsp;my&nbsp;body. When I&nbsp;was younger, everybody was telling me&nbsp;what was wrong with my&nbsp;body&nbsp;— too this, too that,” she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>declared</a> a&nbsp;while ago.</p><p><h2>Sharon has a&nbsp;greater fondness for her appearance now than she did in&nbsp;her youth.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/ff3/ea6/9bef0452689d72e72247405593.png><p>Unlike her younger self, who may have been more critical or&nbsp;uncertain, Stone now embraces her unique features and exudes a&nbsp;newfound confidence and self-love. In&nbsp;the past, lacking experience and confidence in&nbsp;the industry, Stone used to&nbsp;let others decide what was best for her appearance.</p><p>“When I&nbsp;got on <i>’Basic Instinct,’</i> they hired a&nbsp;makeup artist that put on&nbsp;pounds of&nbsp;makeup every day, and every day&nbsp;I went to&nbsp;my&nbsp;trailer and took the makeup off,” she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a>.</p><p><h2>After suffering a&nbsp;stroke, her perception of&nbsp;aging completely changed.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d7d/35c/c3ba0757f4baccddc0c30aeec6.jpg><p>NDZ/STAR MAX/IPx/Associated Press/East News</p><p>Today she focuses on&nbsp;appreciating what her body does for her instead of&nbsp;criticizing it&nbsp;for any supposed imperfections. She openly shared that her favorite time in&nbsp;life was actually her fabulous forties when she took a&nbsp;break to&nbsp;prioritize self-care after experiencing a&nbsp;<a href=# title=stroke data-link=tag>stroke</a> in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>2001</a>.</p><p>“My&nbsp;40s were so&nbsp;beautiful. I&nbsp;couldn’t work because women, once they got to&nbsp;be&nbsp;40, were not given jobs in&nbsp;Hollywood. I&nbsp;was a&nbsp;mom with three beautiful little boys. I&nbsp;was recovering from a&nbsp;massive brain injury,” she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>confessed</a>.</p><p>“But there was something wonderful in&nbsp;that period of&nbsp;all those challenges. And even though no&nbsp;one wanted to&nbsp;date&nbsp;me, no&nbsp;one would want a&nbsp;woman that had little children, it&nbsp;was a&nbsp;period of&nbsp;reconciliation and change, and understanding myself. It&nbsp;was my&nbsp;period of&nbsp;the biggest change, but the period where&nbsp;I thought&nbsp;I was the most beautiful.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b7b/c22/86cffa514086f8d8e5211f0a4b.jpg><p>Collin Xavier/Image Press Agency ABACA/Abaca/East News</p><p>After the stroke, Sharon had a&nbsp;bunch of&nbsp;surgeries to&nbsp;lift one side of&nbsp;her face. But afterward, she had an&nbsp;even greater <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>realization</a> about letting age take its course and embracing graceful aging without unnecessary meddling.</p><p>Now, she has found the confidence and self-love that she lacked when she was younger, and that’s why she wants to&nbsp;inspire her <a href=# title=community data-link=tag>community</a> to&nbsp;do&nbsp;the same. The star <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>aims</a> to&nbsp;be&nbsp;honest with all her followers and not let the Hollywood facade of&nbsp;“forever youth” deceive them. “I&nbsp;think when&nbsp;I was young, it&nbsp;was my&nbsp;ambition. It&nbsp;was so&nbsp;intense. Taking off the tough veneer and telling the truth has been my&nbsp;latest mission.”</p><p>She’s a&nbsp;total legend, and even after all these years, she never ceases to&nbsp;amaze her fans. At&nbsp;65, Stone looks incredibly <a href=#>youthful</a> and natural, and we&nbsp;can’t help but admire her for&nbsp;it.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZMCprdGopWarpKS7pnmVbmSrp5OgwG6z0ZqwZqCRnr9urc2dZJuZopp6p63CnmSopl2ovKS1wKVkpp2Unq5uwM5mp6unppp6qbvWZqynppWYsrS%2FwKuwZqulp7SmvthmoKxlaGaAen2TaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

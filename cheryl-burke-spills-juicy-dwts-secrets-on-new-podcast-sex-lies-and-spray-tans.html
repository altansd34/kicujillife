According to Burke, this new project is something that they owe to the fans of the ABC series.</p><p>“Because I do believe the fans also have their own conspiracy theories, but that’s only because there’s only a two-hour live show … You only get to see a little, tiny glimpse of the celebrity, let alone the chemistry between the celebrity and the pro, which is a shame,” she said.</p><p>In the podcast, Burke and her chosen guest will detail the drama, fights, and romance that happened onstage and backstage of the show. Burke’s guests will either be a former celebrity contestant or a co-dancer, or a judge.</p><p>The first two episodes of Sex, Lies, And Spray Tans are already out, in which Burke spoke to season one contestant Trista Sutter and season 24 alum Heather Morris. On Instagram, Burke cited five reasons as to why fans should listen to her audio project.</p><p>“If you just want a good juicy gossip, fun flirty and just completely innocent and you wanna listen to some of your favorite contestants on Dancing With The Stars that has ever graced our ballroom floor, just listen. Like, right now,” she said.</p><p>Elsewhere in the post, the professional dancer will be discussing “true, false, kinda true, kinda false” headlines and rumors on the show. She also revealed that some of her guests are spilling the tea during their respective seasons on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">DWTS</a>.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-her-future-episode-involves-romance-conversations-with-maks-chmerkovskiy>Her Future Episode Involves Romance Conversations with Maks Chmerkovskiy</h2><p>During her interview with<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"> Access Hollywood</a>, Burke revealed that she’s got her episode ready with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Maks Chmerkovskiy</a>. As a sneak peek, the two talked about the romances that grew between celebrities and their pro partners. Such juicy conversation will air in the future episode of the podcast.</p><p>“I asked Maks Chmerkovskiy this question: it’s like, ‘Who do you think falls in love first? Is it the celebrities or the pros?’ And he has his reasoning, you know?” she shared.</p><p>Burke also teased that she asked Chmerkovskiy multiple hard questions that made him sweat.</p><p>“I asked him questions like, ‘If you could go back in time, who’s the one celebrity partner you would apologize to? Who was the most talented? [Who] do you think should’ve won? Who did you have the most chemistry with? Who would you be OK with never seeing again?'” she said. “He answers it, but he was sweating. It’s hard!”</p><p>For those who may not know, Burke was a Dancing With the Stars professional dancer for 26 seasons. Since she was on the show for so long, it’s no surprise that she’s familiar with almost all of the rumors surrounding around the series. If you want to listen in Burke’s podcast, Sex, Lies, and Spray Tans will post a new episode each week.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Original_SharnaBurgess_JesseMetclife_Kelsey-McNealABC-via-Getty-Images-220x147.jpg alt="‘DWTS’ Pro Sharna Burgess Claims That This is Her Worst Dance Partner Ever" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57wqGcq7GcYq%2B2vsqeZKyomaG5tHnJrqCcsV2ZxLW%2FjKycnKqVqcBuu81mpZ6vXaW8pa%2FArKtmq5Wteq21xKxkmqaUYsCxvsCyZK2Znqh8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

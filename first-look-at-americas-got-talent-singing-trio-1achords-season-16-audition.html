Tavis Kordell Cunningham, Julian Kennedy, and Christoff Hairston are a singing trio that only met a month and a half before their big audition.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-1achord-blows-america-s-got-talent-judges-away-with-unique-sound>1aChord Blows ‘America’s Got Talent’ Judges Away With Unique Sound</h2><p>All three members of 1aChord are students at UNC Greensboro in North Carolina. They were all in the cafeteria at the same time and ended up sitting at a table together one day. Julian was wearing a sweatshirt that had an artist that they all love on it. They began bonding over their shared love for music and artists like Beyonce and Whitney Houston.</p><p>Naturally, they started singing together right there in the cafeteria. After getting hyped up from the lunch ladies who told them to “sing baby,” they decided to form the group 1aChord. Sharing this story up on stage makes 1aChord feel so personable and friendly to viewers of the show. This group is absolutely not lacking in personality or talent.</p><p>“That was like someone explaining a movie from beginning to end in about 20 seconds,” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Simon Cowell</a> said after hearing how the group formed.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>For their performance of “Fix You” by Coldplay, Julian sat at the piano and the trio harmonized the first note of the song. Each group member had solo moments to highlight their individual voices. Whenever their voices come together, it’s game-changing. They did something a little bit different from the typical arrangement of the song. They opted for a more upbeat breakdown of “Fix You” with a unique flair.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-did-they-get-voted-through-to-the-next-round>Did They Get Voted Through to the Next Round?</h2><p><a href=#>Sofia Vergara</a>‘s jaw was on the floor by the end of 1aChord’s performance. The judges gave them a standing ovation. Each member of 1aChord was emotional by the judge’s reactions to their performance. “Fantastic,” Cowell uttered while clapping. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Terry Crews</a> called the performance “incredible” from backstage. “Fix You” has never been sung like this on a talent show. This is something 1aChord should be very proud of.</p><p>America’s Got Talent left fans hanging and did not reveal whether or not the judges voted 1aChord through to the next round of the competition. Based on their performance and the judge’s reaction, they will definitely be voted through to the Judge Cuts. You can catch 1aChord and so many other <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">tremendous acts</a> when <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 16</a> of America’s Got Talent <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">premieres on June 1.</a></p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Christina-Grimmie-The-Voice-audition.jpeg alt="Watch: ‘The Voice’ Star Christina Grimmie’s Powerhouse Blind Audition" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>America's Got Talent</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57xaKprKxdobywt4yaq2aZnZq%2Fqq%2FArGSgp6RiwaK4xKerZquZo7SqusZmq6uhn2J%2Boq%2FHqKmdq12osqK%2Fzqdkam5dlsKltdOipqdn</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

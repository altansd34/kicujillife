At Bright Side, we’ve found out that oversharing equals insecurity, and we want to discuss it with you.

Every time we&nbsp;check our accounts we&nbsp;dive into the romantic gestures and thoughts shared by&nbsp;those who are crazy in&nbsp;love. And some of&nbsp;us are these people. But scientists have <a href=#>revealed</a> that a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;couples may actually be&nbsp;hiding a&nbsp;darker side of&nbsp;their perfect well-being, and it’s something we&nbsp;have to&nbsp;think about.</p><p>At&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side</strong>, we’ve found out that oversharing equals insecurity, and we&nbsp;want to&nbsp;discuss it&nbsp;with you.</p><p><h2>There’s a&nbsp;line.</h2></p><p>It&nbsp;can be&nbsp;perfectly healthy to&nbsp;share your romantic snaps from time to&nbsp;time. For example, previous studies <a href=#>showed</a> that people who had a&nbsp;couple profile picture were more satisfied with their relationship and felt closer to&nbsp;each other. But according to&nbsp;other experts, there’s a&nbsp;limit to&nbsp;how far this can&nbsp;go.</p><p>In&nbsp;the study, “<a href=#>Can You Tell That I’m in&nbsp;a&nbsp;Relationship? Attachment and Relationship Visibility on&nbsp;Facebook</a>” a&nbsp;group of&nbsp;scientists hypothesized that<strong> those who try to&nbsp;make their relationships more visible may feel insecure about their partner’s feelings</strong>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/40b/2d1/121c285998b743ad3fe64d13d8.jpg><p>This idea was proven correct over the course of&nbsp;an&nbsp;<a href=#>experiment</a> that involved 108 dating couples. Each person filled out a&nbsp;short online survey every night for 2&nbsp;weeks. They reported their feelings and thoughts about relationships, as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;their activity on&nbsp;<a href=# title=Facebook data-link=tag>Facebook</a> including photos, wall posts, comments, and status updates. According to&nbsp;the results, <strong>on&nbsp;days when participants felt more insecure, they posted more relationship-relevant information</strong>.</p><p><h2>Other experts confirm the findings and added more to&nbsp;the point.</h2></p><p>This conclusion was also supported by&nbsp;relationship expert, <a href=#>Nikki Goldstein</a>. In&nbsp;her opinion, <strong>people who promote “their relationship online are often battling insecurities or&nbsp;having problems with their significant other.”</strong> For example, they seek validation for their relations from others, and likes and comments can be&nbsp;very validating. And when someone is&nbsp;really struggling, “that’s where they get their up&nbsp;from.”</p><p>But insecurity isn’t the only issue here. <a href=#>Researchers</a> from Brunel University also revealed that <strong>people who often update followers about their romantic partners may have low self-esteem</strong>.</p><p>According to&nbsp;scientists, such behavior can be&nbsp;explained by&nbsp;the desire to&nbsp;boost self-worth and to&nbsp;refute others’ impressions that their relationship is&nbsp;doing poorly. They seek validation to&nbsp;show themselves and others that their relationship is&nbsp;fine, thus, proving that they’re also fine.</p><p><h2>Check yourself before updating.</h2></p><p>Of&nbsp;course, there’s no&nbsp;way to&nbsp;measure if&nbsp;you go&nbsp;beyond the limit of&nbsp;posting about your relationship. All in&nbsp;all, whether you’re posting a&nbsp;lot or&nbsp;prefer to&nbsp;keep silent about your romantic life, it’s how you feel that matters most. Try to&nbsp;listen to&nbsp;yourself next time you are going to&nbsp;share something about your love. Do&nbsp;you want to&nbsp;post it&nbsp;because it’s a&nbsp;truly happy moment in&nbsp;your real relationship or&nbsp;because you are more interested in&nbsp;how it&nbsp;looks online?</p><p>How often do&nbsp;you post about your relationships? Why? Do&nbsp;you think that there’s truth in&nbsp;these findings?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZK6kr86rm6Kml2LBsHnAZqqtrZSueqS71KmjnqtdrLWwec%2Boqq1lkWK5sMCMmpmoraRiwamxzKycpa6VqHqwuoysppyhkaF6rrHDophmmaKaeqq60p6arqqVYoR6gI9tZ2g%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

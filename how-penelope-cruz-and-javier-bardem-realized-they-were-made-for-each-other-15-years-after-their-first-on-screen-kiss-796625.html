Once upon a&nbsp;time in&nbsp;1992...</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/bf0/325/b208d85ca5b14e99fe858149df.jpg><p>They met for the first time in&nbsp;1992 and had a&nbsp;troubled affair in&nbsp;front of&nbsp;the camera. Penélope Cruz was only 16&nbsp;years old when she <a href=#>accepted </a>to&nbsp;appear in&nbsp;a&nbsp;film for the first time. It&nbsp;was <a href=#>Jamón Jamón</a> and her costar was Javier Bardem in&nbsp;his early twenties. In&nbsp;his role, he&nbsp;tried to&nbsp;win her heart. Bardem explained years later that even if&nbsp;nothing happened then, there was obvious <a href=#>chemistry </a>between them.</p><p><h2>2. They parted ways.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/42d/8cd/6585db53ed92c9a8d3bc8b7944.jpg><p><h2>3. Woody Allen set the scene for the crush to&nbsp;occur.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/904/d68/fab0ca546f915706b88799df0c.jpg><p>The film <a href=#>Vicky Cristina Barcelona</a> reunited <a href=#>both </a>of&nbsp;them under the direction of&nbsp;Woody Allen. It&nbsp;was then that Bardem caught Cruz’s attention. He&nbsp;has recognized that during the shoot, neither of&nbsp;them dared to&nbsp;make the first move. They wanted to&nbsp;keep it&nbsp;professional until the very last day of&nbsp;filming. Luckily for them, a&nbsp;friend threw an&nbsp;end-of-filming party and well, the rest is&nbsp;history, as&nbsp;Bardem <a href=#>explained</a>.</p><p><h2>4. To&nbsp;start dating was a&nbsp;mediated decision.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/fd0/8bd/e9270a5c7d87e5a047993273a0.jpg><p>There were some doubts about their relationship. Bardem has <a href=#>confessed </a>that he&nbsp;hesitated at&nbsp;first, particularly while they were filming the scenes full of&nbsp;intense arguments in&nbsp;<a href=#>Vicky Cristina Barcelona</a>. The role Cruz played, which was an&nbsp;overwhelming and passionate woman, had impressed him in&nbsp;such a&nbsp;way that he&nbsp;wondered if&nbsp;he&nbsp;really wanted that kind of&nbsp;character in&nbsp;his life. However, those scenes were only fiction and their actual life together is&nbsp;a&nbsp;haven of&nbsp;peace.</p><p><h2>5. As&nbsp;their love blossomed, they hit sweet spots in&nbsp;their careers.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/674/8d2/1865dd56e4866f7c98e6c43350.jpg><p>The same year they fell in&nbsp;love, Javier Bardem <a href=#>won </a>an&nbsp;Oscar in&nbsp;2007 for his role in&nbsp;<a href=#>No&nbsp;Country for Old Men</a>. The very next year, Penélope Cruz received her own <a href=#>Oscar </a>for the role she played in&nbsp;<a href=#>Vicky Cristina Barcelona</a>. This was a&nbsp;sweet moment in&nbsp;both their personal and professional lives, just in&nbsp;time for their relationship to&nbsp;begin. It&nbsp;really was a&nbsp;dream come true!</p><p><h2>6. They secretly got married on&nbsp;Johnny Depp’s private island.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/2db/e95/6eb1c35dafbbabdf3077583d5e.jpg><p>In&nbsp;2010&nbsp;at Cannes, Javier Bardem won the “Best Actor” award for <a href=#>Biutiful</a> and wanted to&nbsp;dedicate a&nbsp;few <a href=#>words </a>to&nbsp;his sweetheart. “To&nbsp;my&nbsp;friend, my&nbsp;partner, my&nbsp;love. Penélope: I&nbsp;owe you a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;things and&nbsp;I love you very much,” the actor said. Maybe those words were a&nbsp;way of&nbsp;asking her to&nbsp;marry him. But their wedding was held in&nbsp;complete privacy and all we&nbsp;<a href=#>know </a>is&nbsp;that the actor <a href=# title="Johnny Depp" data-link=tag>Johnny Depp</a> was the host of&nbsp;the ceremony at&nbsp;his house in&nbsp;The Bahamas.</p><p><h2>7. We&nbsp;waited 3&nbsp;years for them to&nbsp;make a&nbsp;public appearance together.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/22b/4f0/4de6345427b0f0bf57f5a1a849.jpg><p>From the beginning, the 2&nbsp;actors decided to&nbsp;be&nbsp;very discreet in&nbsp;their relationship. We&nbsp;only could see them holding hands in&nbsp;2010 after 3&nbsp;years of&nbsp;being together. As&nbsp;a&nbsp;result of&nbsp;their love, in&nbsp;2011 and in&nbsp;2013, the couple experienced the birth of&nbsp;their 2&nbsp;children, <a href=#>Leo and Luna</a>. They still were determined not to&nbsp;show them in&nbsp;public and have never released a&nbsp;photograph with them. Cruz <a href=#>said</a> that their privacy is&nbsp;sacred and both she and Bardem have <a href=#>recognized </a>that they strive to&nbsp;separate fiction from their relationship reality.</p><p><h2>8. “The most wonderful traveling companion”</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/969/ee4/4653835213b4d4760be441a85b.jpg><p>Although they don’t usually <a href=#>talk </a>about their relationship, we’ve recently heard them express their love for each other. Cruz had <a href=#>said </a>that Bardem was the most wonderful traveling companion she could have. “He&nbsp;was included in&nbsp;my&nbsp;dreams and is&nbsp;here with&nbsp;me,” <a href=#>claimed</a> the actress. Bardem has <a href=#>described </a>her as&nbsp;a&nbsp;woman that has “loving blood” as&nbsp;a&nbsp;way to&nbsp;express how passionate she is&nbsp;for everything and how much he&nbsp;is&nbsp;attracted to&nbsp;it. There’s beauty and being seductive&nbsp;— and for <a href=#>him</a>, Cruz has both.</p><p><h2>9. They’ve shown that they are a&nbsp;strong couple both in&nbsp;front of&nbsp;and behind the camera.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/928/cdb/33b80855aebf993a3c873839c9.jpg><p>Now, as&nbsp;husband and wife, they repeat their experience as&nbsp;co-stars. In&nbsp;both <a href=#>Everybody Knows</a> and <a href=#>Loving Pablo</a>, we&nbsp;can see that there’s a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;trust between the actors. Even if&nbsp;it’s not something they <a href=#>want </a>to&nbsp;do&nbsp;all of&nbsp;the time, they don’t close the door to&nbsp;sharing protagonism if&nbsp;the occasion calls for&nbsp;it.</p><p><h2>10. Their family and the things they stand for are priorities that strengthen their love.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a8e/c74/b24902556b9d5d31f64d120152.jpg><p>Their main <a href=#>priority </a>is&nbsp;to&nbsp;raise their kids, but they’re also committed to&nbsp;environmental and social causes. Cruz <a href=#>directed </a>a&nbsp;documentary about childhood leukemia and has <a href=#>posed </a>for ads supporting PETA’s anti-fur campaign. Meanwhile, Bardem has become an&nbsp;Antarctic defender. He&nbsp;has recently <a href=#>joined </a>a&nbsp;Greenpeace research expedition as&nbsp;part of&nbsp;a&nbsp;campaign to&nbsp;create a&nbsp;vast Antarctic ocean sanctuary. Activism and protecting their family intimacy help them to&nbsp;keep the flame of&nbsp;love burning bright.</p><p>Don’t you think that there was an&nbsp;element of&nbsp;destiny in&nbsp;their love story? Do&nbsp;you know of&nbsp;any other actors that are meant for each other?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLWww4ypnKednKS9pnnCq6yzZZGjsW62wK%2Bgnqpdl66zsMSmZKudkaG2u7HDZquhnalixKa%2BxGakmpyVYrOwvoyemJygXaTBqbHRZmhuZamarrO%2FjJqdrZ2iYsGpscirZJ%2BhoqjBbrvNZqqcqpWau263yKyqZm9pa4NzgY4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

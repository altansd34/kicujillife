Again, majorities of supporters of each party appear to be in agreement.</p><p>In December, the <a href=#>government abandoned plans for House of Lords reform</a> that would have reduced its size significantly and made it a mostly elected body. Nick Clegg was a leading proponent of the plans, which were initially supported but the coalition government but were scuttled amid considerable opposition from rank-and-file Conservative MPs.</p><p>YouGov’s latest research finds that public opinion on the best way to reform the House of Lords reflects some of those divisions: faced with a number of reform scenarios, the most popular option was different among supporters of each party.</p><p>For Conservative voters, the most popular option was leaving the House of Lords as is – 32% want it to remain an appointed chamber. Labour voters most want it to become a wholly elected chamber, the option chosen by 28%. Lib Dem voters want the option that arguably most resembles the scenario sought by their party’s leader: 41% want the House of Lords replaced with a chamber that is part elected and part appointed. The most popular option among UKIP voters, however, chosen by 27%, was abolishing the House of Lords entirely.</p><p>The family of one new appointee, Sir Anthony Bamford, has reportedly given around £2.5m to the Conservative party over the years. Other high-profile donors whose names are on the list of new peers include James Polumbo, who founded the Ministry of Sound nightclub and has given the Lib Dems almost £700,000, and Sir William Haughey, <a href=#>who has given the Labour Party more than £1m since 2003</a>.</p><p>Nick Clegg has said the new peers "will make a valuable contribution to British politics, the House of Lords and the Liberal Democrat team in Westminster", while a Labour party spokesman said the party "totally refutes" the alleged link between giving donations and receiving peerages.</p><p>Image courtesy of Getty.</p><p><a href=#><strong>See the full poll results</strong></a></p><p class=title><a href=#>Join YouGov today!

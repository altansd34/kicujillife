Sporty Spice comes in second on 23%, followed by Ginger on 19% and Posh on 12%. Scary Spice proved the least popular of the group, with only 9% saying they thought she was the best member.</p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/Spice20girls20toplines-01.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h4><strong>Girl Power is strongest among those who say Scary Spice is their favourite</strong></h4><p>The Spice Girls were all about Girl Power, and none more so than fans of Scary Spice. While 83-90% of those with a favourite Spice Girl believe in gender equality, only a minority would describe themselves as “feminist”. (As previous YouGov research <a href=#>has shown</a>, this is a common attitude). However, it is those who favour Scary Spice who are the most happy with the term, at 31% (compared to 15-20% for fans of the others).</p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/Girl20Power-01.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h4><strong>Gotta get with my friends – friendship is most important to those who favour Posh Spice</strong></h4><p>The importance of friendship was a key theme emphasised by the Spice Girls, most notably in their hit Wannabe. This resonates most with Posh Spice’s fans, who are the most likely (75%) to agree with the statement “my friendship group is a really important part of my life”. The least likely to agree are those who favour Sporty Spice, at 62%.</p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/Spice20girls20friends-01.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h4><strong>Posh also has the most fashionable fanbase</strong></h4><p>Given Victoria Beckham’s post-Spice career as a clothes designer, it is not surprising to see that her fans are notably more fashion-conscious. Half (50%) of Posh Spice’s fans say they keep up to date with current fashion trends and four in ten (38%) say they spend a lot of money on clothes, compared to 29% and 16% respectively of those who prefer one of the other band members.</p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/Spice20Girls20fashion-01.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h4><strong>Scary Spice’s fans are the biggest music lovers</strong></h4><p>Almost one in five (18%) of Scary’s fans describe themselves as a “music obsessive”, more than twice as many as those who prefer another band member. They are also the most likely to describe themselves as a “music lover”, at 51%.</p><p>Scary’s fanbase are also the most likely to say that the 90s is their favourite music era, at 27%.</p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/Spice20Girls20music20love-01.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h4><strong>Posh Spice has the poshest fans…</strong></h4><p>Those who say that Victoria Beckham is their favourite Spice Girl are the most likely to be middle class, with those in the ABC1 socio-demographic group accounting for 61% of Posh’s fanbase. She also has the highest proportion of the most well-to-do fans, with 19% living in a household where the chief income earner is in a higher managerial, administrative or professional occupation (that is to say, is an ‘A’ on the ABC1C2DE scale).</p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/Spice20Girls20by20class-01.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h4><strong>…but fans of Sporty Spice aren’t any more sporty</strong></h4><p>By contrast, fans of Sporty Spice are not noticeably more interested in sport than fans of the other Spice Girls. Four in ten (42%) of those who favour Mel C say they are either “sports mad” or “follow sports closely”, putting them in the middle of the range for all Spice Girls fans (37-46%).</p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/Spice20Girls20sport-01.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h4><strong>Ginger Spice’s fanbase is the most male</strong></h4><p>Geri has the most male fanbase, with 60% of those choosing her as their favourite Spice Girl being men. Fans of Baby Spice are also more likely to be male than female (56% vs 44%). Posh Spice has the most female-dominated fanbase, with 57% being women and 43% men.</p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/Spice20Girls20by20gender-01.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h4><strong>Posh’s fans are the youngest</strong></h4><p>Posh also has the youngest set of fans. Four in ten (40%) who pick her as their favourite Spice Girl are aged 18-34. By contrast, only 20% of Sporty Spice’s fans are in the same age bracket – Mel C’s fans tend to be the oldest, with 61% being aged at least 45.</p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/Spice20Girls20by20age-01.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmixn6q0sMKNnKZnrZtkvbC4yK2gnKtflr%2B1tcKlnKxnYmWBeIGMcmStoJmjtLR52KisoKemYrOwwc2dZKitpGKuo7vUrWSfmZ6oerS8yJycZp%2BZp7m0</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

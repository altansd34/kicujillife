He charmed the judges (even Simon Cowell) and made it to the Judge Cuts of Season 11. What has Nathan been up to in the time since the show?</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-nathan-bockstahler-made-the-agt-judges-laugh>Nathan Bockstahler Made the ‘AGT’ Judges Laugh</h2><p>Before his audition, Nathan told the judges that he would rather have a million LEGOs than the $1 million prize. During <a href=#>his performance</a>, he joked about having ADHD and shared how shocked he was to learn that Mom isn’t his mother’s real name.</p><p>Nathan told fellow comedian Howie Mandel that he writes his own material, but his mom types it up for him. Heidi Klum was impressed, calling him a “charmer.” Simon Cowell predicted that America would fall in love with Nathan.</p><p>The young comedian got four “yes” votes from the judges to go to the next round. In the Judge Cuts, he joked about the little lies his parents tell, like his mom telling him foods are spicy whenever he wants a bite. Mel B called him “cute as a button.” Unfortunately, Nathan didn’t make it to the live shows.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO:</strong> <strong><a href=# class=broken_link>5 YOUNGEST AND CUTEST KID AUDITIONS THAT WILL MELT YOUR HEART</a></strong></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-what-happened-to-nathan-after-the-show>What Happened to Nathan After the Show?</h3><p>After being eliminated from AGT Season 11, Nathan took his comedy routine to other talent shows, even one across the pond. First, he appeared on the show <a href=#>Little Big Shots</a> in 2017. Host Steve Harvey told Nathan that he has “natural timing.”</p><p>Nathan shared his dream to star on his own reality show, and maybe become the president or an astronaut in his spare time. He also charmed the audience by saying, “Money is not the most important thing. Family is.”</p><p>Then in 2018, Nathan appeared on <a href=#>Little Big Shots UK</a>. He joked about the differences between American and British English, asking, “French fries are chips? Chips are crisps? And what is a loo?” He was also disappointed not to see any flying nannies when he landed in London.</p><p>Nathan is 12 years old now. Unfortunately, he’s not active on social media, and he doesn’t appear to have performed lately, perhaps due to the Covid-19 pandemic. No word on if he ever got those million LEGOs he wanted, but we’re hoping to see him on the stage again soon!</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/NUP_195222_01884-1.jpg alt="‘America’s Got Talent’s Most Impressive Acts from Around the World" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>America's Got Talent</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK571qGYrWWYlr2xsc2em2asn2KDbsXEmqlmp5yZeqKz02aaqKWVmbaiuoynmK2gkaN6o7vCpKqtmZihsrN7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

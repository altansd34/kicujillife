Sid Kingsley (Team Kelly)</h3><p>Sid Kingsley was Kelly’s steal during the Battles. Desz is a four-chair turn that was super excited to work with Usher. Desz took on Tevin Campbell’s “Can We Talk.” The coaches agreed that her range and being able to go so low led her to completely slay the song. Sid sang Foy Vance’s “Make It Rain” and the coaches felt that he really brought the soul. Kelly said she would listen to Sid’s record and that she was stupid for putting these artists against each other. She chose Desz as the winner of the Knockout. John and Blake both hit their steals and it was seriously the ultimate battle to get Sid on their teams. Sid chose to be on Team Blake.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og5X5m50zvk</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-jus-john-vs-jim-ranger-team-blake>Jus John Vs.

Bailey Rae (Team Legend)</h3><p>Bailey Rae is the only country artist on John’s team this season. Lauren Frihauf was stolen by John during the Battles. Bailey performed Billy Currington’s “Let Me Down Easy.” This Knockout really came down to song selection for the coaches. Blake said that he felt like Bailey should be on his team. Lauren sang Janis Joplin’s “Cry Baby” and the coaches complimented her vocal style. John chose Bailey as the winner of the Knockout.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPfwVkdCuTQ</p></figure><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO:<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> BLAKE SHELTON ALMOST HURTS HIMSELF TURNING AROUND FOR ‘THE VOICE’ SINGER [VIDEO]</a></strong></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-ian-flanigan-vs-james-pyle-team-blake>Ian Flanigan Vs. James Pyle (Team Blake)</h3><p>Ian Flanigan sang Luke Combs’ “Beautiful Crazy.” The coaches praised him about the sincerity and mysteriousness of his voice.

Blake said that it was exciting to see such enthusiasm throughout his performance. Blake chose Ian as the winner of the Knockout.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oq9QOd_LFP4</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-kelsie-watts-vs-madeline-consoer-team-kelly>Kelsie Watts Vs. Madeline Consoer (Team Kelly)</h3><p>Kelsie Watts took on a Kelly song during her audition but during the Knockouts, she chose to sing “You Oughta Know” by Alanis Morissette. John said that Kelsie did a good job of staying true to herself during the song. Madeline Consoer went country with her rendition of Maddie & Tae’s “Die From a Broken Heart.” Blake and Gwen’s eyes lit up when they heard Madeline sing. Kelly chose Madeline as the winner of the Knockout.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VXmtUH55Q4</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-carter-rubin-vs-chloe-hogan-team-gwen>Carter Rubin Vs. Chloe Hogan (Team Gwen)</h3><p>Carter Rubin is a 14-year-old powerhouse that sang “You Say.” Once again the coaches praised Carter for his ability to hit pretty much any note. Chloe definitely had the breakout performance of the night singing SWV’s “Weak.” Gwen felt that not picking Chloe would be a mistake because she felt like John would steal her. Gwen chose Carter as the winner of the Knockout. Well, Gwen was right when she said John would steal Chloe. She will also be going to the Live Playoffs.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHnVCk_5RrI</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-joseph-soul-vs-van-andrew-team-gwen>Joseph Soul Vs.

How Meg came up with the idea to start a business.
Meg’s husband created a wooden plaque to commemorate her breastfeeding journey, “He wanted to make me something that would mean the world, that would say, ’Thank you for taking care of our kids."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

They made breast <a href=# title=milk data-link=tag>milk</a> pieces as&nbsp;a&nbsp;hobby for about a&nbsp;year. Everything changed when they created a&nbsp;<a href=# title=TikTok data-link=tag>TikTok</a> account. The response was phenomenal, and they quickly gained the trust of&nbsp;their customers and audience.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/4b7/44f/be2d0e53fe88390eac8cc078c5.jpg><p>It&nbsp;was at&nbsp;this time that they received their first order for creating memorial jewelry. It&nbsp;was a&nbsp;mom asking if&nbsp;they could incorporate her son’s ashes into a&nbsp;piece. A&nbsp;woman had a&nbsp;terminal pregnancy, so&nbsp;she knew that she wasn’t going to&nbsp;be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;bring her baby home. Meg <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>recalls</a>, “She wanted to&nbsp;get a&nbsp;piece of&nbsp;him to&nbsp;be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;hold him, to&nbsp;have a&nbsp;tangible piece of&nbsp;him.”</p><p>Megan was scared to&nbsp;do&nbsp;it, she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>remembers</a> the moment she got the milk and the ashes that the woman sent her, “I&nbsp;was petrified that&nbsp;I was gonna screw something up&nbsp;because ashes are different than milk. The milk you can recreate, but not ashes.” It&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>took</a> her 24&nbsp;hours to&nbsp;make this wooden plaque and plenty of&nbsp;time to&nbsp;recover, “I&nbsp;sat there, and&nbsp;I cried for a&nbsp;while.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c59/f1e/082b9558cc8381646b0b2540fd.jpg><p>When the mother saw the finished piece, Meg <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>received</a> a&nbsp;powerful reaction that continues to&nbsp;motivate her even during the darkest days, “That mom said something that will always stick with&nbsp;me, ’You gave me&nbsp;my&nbsp;child back.’” She <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>continues</a>, “That’s why we&nbsp;do&nbsp;what we&nbsp;do&nbsp;to&nbsp;be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;give you your loved one back, to&nbsp;be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;have something to&nbsp;hold, hug and kiss.”</p><p><h2>There are not only breast milk or&nbsp;ashes.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b07/64d/7693de5e70a7f1389cca3f5876.jpg><p>There are so&nbsp;many things that Megan and her team&nbsp;do. They are open to&nbsp;the use of&nbsp;any material to&nbsp;create memorial pieces if&nbsp;it’s important to&nbsp;someone within reason, “So&nbsp;breast milk and ashes are two most popular things. We&nbsp;have burial dirt, hair, placenta, belt, belt cord, clothing, blankets, and any sort of&nbsp;cloth. I’ve done embryos.”</p><p>They also have a&nbsp;pet section. She <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>continues</a>, “We&nbsp;work a&nbsp;lot with pets, create all of&nbsp;our jewelry and frames with pet ashes and fur as&nbsp;well. I&nbsp;lost one of&nbsp;my, my&nbsp;first baby is&nbsp;what&nbsp;I call him. And I&nbsp;remember&nbsp;I couldn’t make his frame. My&nbsp;husband had to&nbsp;make it&nbsp;because it&nbsp;was so&nbsp;terribly emotional, he&nbsp;really was like my&nbsp;child, and he&nbsp;suddenly passed.”</p><p><h2>Meg also finds healing from her own grief by&nbsp;supporting others.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/afc/552/7bcbe256f9affedc1f05f40ea3.jpg><p>She puts her whole heart and soul into every single piece as&nbsp;they’re going home to&nbsp;be&nbsp;loved and mourned forever. Megan believes that such memorable pieces are a&nbsp;great conversation starter for those who have suffered loss, because a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;the times it’s silenced both internally and externally.</p><p>She <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>explains</a>, “It’s hard to&nbsp;<a href=# title=communicate data-link=tag>communicate</a> with people afterward because you want to&nbsp;talk about this, but half of&nbsp;you are afraid. And that’s how&nbsp;I felt after our loss. We&nbsp;miscarried two babies, and&nbsp;I was always so&nbsp;terrified to&nbsp;talk about it&nbsp;because&nbsp;I didn’t want people to&nbsp;ask questions that&nbsp;I didn’t know how to&nbsp;answer.”</p><p>Megan <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>continues</a>, “I&nbsp;mean, we’re all keen to&nbsp;share our positive news, but we&nbsp;need, and we&nbsp;want quite to&nbsp;share our sadness and our painful news with people. It’s so&nbsp;hard and&nbsp;I read that in&nbsp;so&nbsp;many stories of&nbsp;their family broke apart because they didn’t know how to&nbsp;communicate that.”</p><p><a href=# title="Cristiano Ronaldo" data-link=tag>Cristiano Ronaldo</a> <a href=#>lost</a> his son at&nbsp;birth, but he&nbsp;and his wife found a&nbsp;heartwarming way to&nbsp;honor his memory.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZK5uw86mmKdlnZa4pr%2BMppymp6KWr62xjKOcsJ2cp8Zuw8itn2aZo52ytHnAp5tmmqKarrTAjKagpaNdqbxutMSlp2aolaS9rbGMoKZmrJinvLazx2aeq6GVm3p5fZNuaGtn</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

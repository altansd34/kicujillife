For example, moviemakers may want to save some time and film a few scenes simultaneously or reduce expenses by using a double who’s paid much less. Sometimes stunt doubles are invited to perform difficult stunts. However, viewers often can’t tell when they’re looking at their favorite actor or their double.
At Bright Side, we found out that many famous movies had such replacements. And sometimes, it’s enough to pause a movie to see them.
Twilight
Very few people noticed that when Edward and Bella were running through the woods, the actors were replaced by people who didn’t look like them at all."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Even sidewise it’s obvious that these are not <a href=# title="Robert Pattinson" data-link=tag>Robert Pattinson</a> and Kristen Stewart but their doubles.</p><p><h2><i>Titanic</i></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7e5/474/65b38f58b59ce070d646343da6.jpg><p>There is&nbsp;a&nbsp;scene in&nbsp;<i><a href=# title=Titanic data-link=tag>Titanic</a></i> where Rose and Jack are running away from the oncoming water, trying to&nbsp;save a&nbsp;boy. Rose’s <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>face</a> looks very strange at&nbsp;this moment, almost as&nbsp;if&nbsp;it’s a&nbsp;mask. And it&nbsp;really&nbsp;is! There’s only Kate’s face in&nbsp;this scene, which was applied to&nbsp;the double’s face with the help of&nbsp;computer graphics.</p><p><h2><i>Friends</i></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/4c2/99a/a67b38546ba4fadd1ed7dc3ad1.jpg><p>In&nbsp;the scene about a&nbsp;robbery (season&nbsp;9, episode 15), <a href=# title="Jennifer Aniston" data-link=tag>Jennifer Aniston</a> was replaced with <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>another</a> girl. For an&nbsp;unknown reason, they even wear different shirts and have different hair colors. But very few people have likely noticed this replacement.</p><p><h2><i>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone</i></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/952/6d2/b369435b7aae841a61c990fe5c.jpg><p>In&nbsp;the <i><a href=# title="Harry Potter" data-link=tag>Harry Potter</a></i> film series, they often used <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>doubles</a>. And it&nbsp;was quite reasonable because the movies had a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;stunts, which would’ve made the production last much longer if&nbsp;they were performed by&nbsp;the actors.</p><p>For example, in&nbsp;the scene with the chess game, Ron suddenly becomes unrecognizable. Perhaps Rupert Grint was replaced with a&nbsp;stunt double before falling from the knight. Most likely it’s <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Anthony Knight</a> who would appear in&nbsp;all 6&nbsp;movies of&nbsp;the franchise from time to&nbsp;time.</p><p><h2><i>Moonraker</i></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/03b/735/da504454918b45e8892a9e1ac1.jpg><p>The villain in&nbsp;the movie, <i>Moonraker</i>, the character has steel teeth before jumping from the helicopter. But during the jump, his teeth become white. Even his appearance changes. This can be&nbsp;explained by&nbsp;the fact that the stunts were performed by&nbsp;stunt <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>doubles</a> Paul Weston and Martin Grace.</p><p><h2><i>Harry Potter and the Prisoner of&nbsp;Azkaban</i></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/028/d5d/b5b48d5a99b634468129da5aa4.jpg><p>As&nbsp;we&nbsp;already mentioned above, many stunt doubles were present in&nbsp;the <i>Harry Potter</i> film series. One of&nbsp;the franchise’s attentive viewers accidentally noticed the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>replacement</a> of&nbsp;the actor who played Severus Snape. This man doesn’t look like Alan Rickman at&nbsp;all. You can really tell the difference by&nbsp;their nose, hair, and chin.</p><p><h2><i>The Avengers</i></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/975/c12/4b12975ba8afab7d991c6f1efa.jpg><p>In&nbsp;the scene of&nbsp;questioning, the Black Widow performs incredible acrobatic tricks, and it’s not surprising that <a href=# title="Scarlett Johansson" data-link=tag>Scarlett Johansson</a> was replaced with a&nbsp;stunt double. During one of&nbsp;the tricks on&nbsp;the chair, you can see an&nbsp;unfamiliar face and muscular hands on&nbsp;the Black Widow, which immediately lets you <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>know</a> that this is&nbsp;not Johansson.</p><p><h2><i>Star Trek: The Next Generation</i></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/24a/5df/7bd52b502a8d3124d757ab1a2d.jpg><p>In&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the combat scenes, you might see that the captain is&nbsp;not Jean-Luc Picard anymore but another person. His strange hair is&nbsp;especially noticeable. Many stunts for Patrick Stewart in&nbsp;this series were performed by&nbsp;stunt double <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Tim Storms</a>.</p><p><h2><i>Terminator&nbsp;2: Judgement Day</i></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/cbf/3af/4d7b3d5549a12bef0e09edce2e.jpg><p>In&nbsp;the famous scene where the Terminator and John Connor are running away from the police, you might see that it’s not <a href=# title="Arnold Schwarzenegger" data-link=tag>Arnold Schwarzenegger</a> riding the motorcycle. Actually, the actor had a&nbsp;few stunt <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>doubles</a> in&nbsp;the movie, including Norman Howell, Peter Kent, and Billy D. Lucas.</p><p><h2><i>Game of&nbsp;Thrones</i></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/bf1/9a0/1333f15fb7bdf84dd304a640ed.png><p>Cersei Lannister was punished for her immoral behavior in&nbsp;season 5. In&nbsp;order to&nbsp;redeem herself, she had to&nbsp;cut her hair and make the “walk of&nbsp;shame.” After the filming was finished, it&nbsp;turned out that Lena Headey had a&nbsp;body <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>double</a> who was actually walking nude with Lena’s head “attached” to&nbsp;her body with the help of&nbsp;computer graphics.</p><p>Did you notice doubles in&nbsp;other movies or&nbsp;shows?

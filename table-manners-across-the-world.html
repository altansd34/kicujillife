Why should you share a good meal with others?</h3><p>If there is one point that unites several cultures across the world, it is that we like starting a meal by wishing others well. Curiously, expressions will not change drastically from country to country in Europe. In Portugal, you might say “Bom apetite”. In German, “Guten Appetit”. You can also use “Bon appétit”, “Buon appetito”, “Gero apetito” and “Buen provecho” in French, Italian, Lithuanian and Spanish, respectively. Of course, the further away you go from Europe,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the more the expression will change</a>!</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>2. Do you start eating before other people?</h3><p>When it comes to table etiquette in different countries, there isn’t any culture in which you can start eating before others are served. You might be surprised to know that in&nbsp;<strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Germany</a></strong>, even starting your drink without others can sometimes be seen as disrespectful. This table principle unites us all around the world: it is considered rude for guests to dig in before the host or oldest person at the table is served and starts eating, especially in countries like Korea, China and India.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>3. Is it bad manners to eat with your hands?</h3><p>In Ethiopia, Southeast Asia (Malaysia, Indonesia, Sri Lanka and India) and in some countries in the Middle East, using your right hand to grab the food directly is not only common, but important. The left hand is often associated with toilet hygiene, so it is best to avoid using it to eat. Make sure you use only your fingertips to grab food and take it to your mouth, rather than your entire hand. Eating&nbsp;burritos&nbsp;and&nbsp;tacos&nbsp;in Mexico? Use your hands. Nobody uses a fork and a knife for these delicious foods! Here’s&nbsp;<strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a handy guide to using your hands to eat around the world</a>.</strong></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>4. To burp or not to burp?&nbsp;</h3><p>In India, Turkey and China, burping is acceptable and even a sign that you’ve enjoyed your meal. In Europe, it is considered extremely rude, as is licking your fingers, making too much noise with cutlery or slurping (in Japan,&nbsp;<strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">slurping your noodles means you’re just loving it</a></strong>!). On a different note, you might want to avoid blowing your nose at the table in South Korea. It is considered disgusting, while relatively normal in Europe – if you’re discreet about it.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>5. Leaving food on your plate: yes or huge no?</h3><p>Growing up in the US or Europe, you might have heard that it’s rude to leave <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">food</a> on your plate. It’s considered disrespectful towards the host, but also to people around the world who are hungry and would give anything to have access to your food. In China, however, it might be a good idea to leave a little food on your plate to show the host they served a filling portion.&nbsp;</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>6. Who pays for what?&nbsp;</h3><p>One of the most confusing aspects of eating out with someone is who gets to pay the bill. In Southern Europe, unless you’re extremely comfortable with your guest (best friend, family member), you’re expected to argue about who is going to pay and insist that you pay. If you were the one inviting the guest to eat out, you’re mostly expected to pay for the entire thing yourself. In Germany and the Netherlands, however,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">it is common for everyone to pay for their own meals</a>, even if they’re meeting for the first time or just visiting.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>7 . What are the rules when eating with chopsticks?</h3><p>One of the most misunderstood tools among Europeans and Americans, chopsticks have their own etiquette. First, they’re not used all over Asia (Thailand, for instance, does not use chopsticks – the spoon is the most important piece of cutlery). Secondly, the position of the chopsticks and the way you handle them can make or break the success of your meal. In China and in Japan, make sure you don’t place the chopsticks on your plate or on top of your food, but rather next to it. Never point at someone with your chopsticks or play with them (drumming, separating them, etc). Most importantly,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">never leave your chopsticks stuck vertically</a> in food or pass food to someone with your chopsticks. Both of these invoke serious images of Chinese funeral rites.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>8. Where can I find salt and pepper</h3><p>Salt and pepper are a must-have at most European tables. However, you may find that in some countries&nbsp;adding salt to your food is considered an insult to the chef, as you lack faith that the dish and feel the need to change its flavor.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>9. Can I go now?</h3><p>The world shares this table rule! Leaving the table immediately after eating is perceived as rude and insulting, almost as if you’re bored or too busy to spend time with your guests. Whether you’re supposed to wait for the host to leave the table or enjoy a good moment of&nbsp;sobremesa&nbsp;in <a href=#>Spain</a>, relax – don’t run!</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.lingoda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/lingoda-2020-favicon.png><h2>Maria Inês Teixeira</h2><p>Maria Inês has been working as a language teacher and blogger for more than 2 years.

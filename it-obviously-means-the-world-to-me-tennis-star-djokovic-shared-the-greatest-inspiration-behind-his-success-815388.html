In&nbsp;September 2013 the couple got engaged and on&nbsp;July 10th, 2014, they tied the knot with a&nbsp;wedding. Earlier in&nbsp;2014, Djokovic shared that they were expecting their <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>first child</a>, a&nbsp;son born in&nbsp;October of&nbsp;the same year. Their daughter Tara arrived a&nbsp;bit later in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>2017</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/46e/c47/cdaa905e47929d83a775b605c8.jpg><p>His recent win at&nbsp;the US&nbsp;Open reminds&nbsp;us of&nbsp;the tough times his family went through to&nbsp;support his success. He’s 36&nbsp;years old now and knows that <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>his family</a> played a&nbsp;big role in&nbsp;helping him become a&nbsp;champion. In&nbsp;a&nbsp;world where famous athletes often get a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;attention, Djokovic’s words are a&nbsp;bright reminder that great <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>achievements</a> come from working hard for a&nbsp;long time and having strong family support.</p><p><h2>The most important thing is&nbsp;not to&nbsp;give up&nbsp;when you think you have lost.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/570/a4d/38113258dcae488ef9ac0335dd.jpg><p>Djokovic had a&nbsp;significant <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>wish</a>: to&nbsp;compete for and win major trophies when his children, Stefan and Tara, were old enough to&nbsp;grasp the significance of&nbsp;such achievements. Both his son and daughter were present in&nbsp;the crowd. It&nbsp;was an&nbsp;epic battle and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>after</a> three hours and 17&nbsp;minutes of&nbsp;intense competition, his opponent struck his final forehand into the net, signaling Djokovic’s victory.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/dd8/9b5/7ab6a2518996fe58c8850d8e75.jpg><p>Dubreuil Corinne/ABACA/Abaca/East News</p><p>“She was facing me&nbsp;when&nbsp;I was sitting on&nbsp;the bench. And she smiled at&nbsp;me. Every single time I&nbsp;needed, I&nbsp;guess that kind of&nbsp;innocent child energy, I&nbsp;got it&nbsp;from her. When I&nbsp;was going through the very stressful moments, particularly in&nbsp;the second set when&nbsp;I needed a&nbsp;little bit of&nbsp;a&nbsp;push of&nbsp;strength, of&nbsp;just lightness, I&nbsp;guess, she gave me&nbsp;a&nbsp;smile, a&nbsp;fist pump. She was into&nbsp;it,” <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a> Djokovic about his daughter.</p><p>“It’s so&nbsp;funny to&nbsp;see that and so&nbsp;interesting to&nbsp;see that she’s six years old, my&nbsp;son is&nbsp;nine, and they were both there. They’re both aware of&nbsp;what’s happening.”</p><p><h2>He&nbsp;dedicated his latest victory to&nbsp;his loved ones.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e60/d0c/222a155974912ace582ed9d2cd.jpg><p>Manu Fernandez/Associated Press/East News</p><p>As&nbsp;Djokovic clinched the second set and ultimately sealed the victory in&nbsp;three sets, his first act of&nbsp;celebration was not to&nbsp;the crowd but to&nbsp;go&nbsp;over to&nbsp;Tara and give her a&nbsp;heartfelt hug. He&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>explained</a>, “She looked at&nbsp;me, and she gave me&nbsp;this energy. That is&nbsp;why&nbsp;I went to&nbsp;her first&nbsp;— of&nbsp;course because she is&nbsp;my&nbsp;daughter, but she also helped me&nbsp;the most in&nbsp;this match. I&nbsp;love her so&nbsp;much, and to&nbsp;have her, my&nbsp;wife, my&nbsp;son Stefan, and my&nbsp;parents&nbsp;— I&nbsp;felt everyone’s support and love. This is&nbsp;their trophy as&nbsp;well.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c15/550/feb13f5668bd2a97dedc023911.jpg><p>This 24th Grand Slam title, secured in&nbsp;his 36th final, was not just a&nbsp;personal triumph for Djokovic; it&nbsp;was a&nbsp;testament to&nbsp;his enduring dedication and passion for the sport. It&nbsp;also solidified his position as&nbsp;a&nbsp;legend in&nbsp;tennis history, moving him two Majors ahead of&nbsp;Rafael Nadal and equaling the record set by&nbsp;Margaret Court from a&nbsp;different era.</p><p>Djokovic <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>spoke</a> to&nbsp;the crowd, “It&nbsp;obviously means the world to&nbsp;me. I’m living my&nbsp;childhood dream to&nbsp;compete in&nbsp;this sport at&nbsp;the top. To&nbsp;make the history of&nbsp;this sport is&nbsp;truly remarkable and special. I&nbsp;never thought&nbsp;I would be&nbsp;talking about 24&nbsp;Slams but the last couple of&nbsp;years&nbsp;I thought&nbsp;I had a&nbsp;shot.”</p><p>Connecting with people from all walks of&nbsp;life was primarily his goal, no&nbsp;matter if&nbsp;they knew about tennis or&nbsp;not. His story shows that even when life is&nbsp;tough, love for our <a href=#>family</a> can guide&nbsp;us through&nbsp;it.</p><p>Preview photo credit Manu Fernandez/Associated Press/East News<span>, </span>Dubreuil Corinne/ABACA/Abaca/East News</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLa1ec6braKnpai5unnMnpinq12ptaZ51qippZxdqbxuucRmq56mnp7Abr%2FTmqlmnJqkuLDCyJxkrKCRp7KledOhnGafopqutbHSrWSipqOltrOt06Kmp2WSmrWqusNmn6KrXajCpK%2FErKpmcGFqgHmEjg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

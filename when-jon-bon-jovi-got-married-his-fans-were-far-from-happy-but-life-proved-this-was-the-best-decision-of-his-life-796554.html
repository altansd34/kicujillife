We at Bright Side think that Jon Bon Jovi’s love story is proof that sometimes we shouldn’t give up, even if the whole world is against us.
Jon Bon Jovi’s decision to get married was very risky and it could’ve ruined his career."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

It&nbsp;all started with small talk and eventually, they started dating. At&nbsp;the peak of&nbsp;<a href=#>Jon’s career in&nbsp;1989</a>, when his band had the number one single and the number one album, he&nbsp;spontaneously suggested to&nbsp;Dorothea to&nbsp;get married in&nbsp;secret.</p><p>As&nbsp;Jon Bon Jovi says, they didn’t tell anybody and ran off to&nbsp;Las Vegas to&nbsp;get married with a&nbsp;cab driver as&nbsp;their witness. Unfortunately, in&nbsp;the beginning, their marriage was not approved by&nbsp;many people, including his mother. She was not impressed by&nbsp;their surprise marriage at&nbsp;all.</p><p><h2>But despite having zero support from the people around him, he&nbsp;never hesitated.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/cfb/429/6304115afa9c1d45a024d2a8e3.jpg><p>On&nbsp;the business side, his manager was furious. He&nbsp;<a href=#>explicitly told Jon</a> that getting married was not a&nbsp;good <a href=# title=career data-link=tag>career</a> move. His fans and the whole of&nbsp;America weren’t happy about their marriage, and many people tried to&nbsp;ruin their <a href=# title=happiness data-link=tag>happiness</a>. But the love birds knew that what they had was beautiful and managed to&nbsp;get through the hard times together. And boy, were they right to&nbsp;stick it&nbsp;out until the end!</p><p><h2>In&nbsp;the end, love triumphed.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/51a/b9d/f6e1a65f69b4a2819c1d4cd612.jpg><p>Today the couple has 4&nbsp;children: one daughter and 3&nbsp;sons. In&nbsp;30&nbsp;years of&nbsp;marriage, neither Jon nor Dorothea doubted their decision about getting married. On&nbsp;the contrary, Jon said that his love for his wife was growing more and more every year. <a href=#>He&nbsp;also revealed</a> that Dorothea is&nbsp;the muse for all the sappy ballads he&nbsp;writes.</p><p><h2>A&nbsp;true happily-ever-after story</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/041/3dd/144ec95c049a7fc15ec723352e.jpg><p>Jon is&nbsp;grateful that he&nbsp;has someone as&nbsp;strong as&nbsp;his wife to&nbsp;love and trust, and that her stabilizing influence helped him reach greater heights. <a href=#>He&nbsp;said that</a> in&nbsp;their marriage, he&nbsp;was the crazy visionary and Dorothea was the one with the glue, needle, and thread, keeping it&nbsp;all together.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/483/cf6/d4cf8753f6b8ad8266356c8576.jpg><p>What do&nbsp;you think about Jon Bon Jovi’s love story?

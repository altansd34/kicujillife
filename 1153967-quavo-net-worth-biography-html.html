Quavious Keyate Marshall’s mother used to work as a hairdresser. His father, unfortunately, passed away when he was only four. As all the kids in the neighborhood, he went to the local school but dropped out without finishing is as he realized his attraction to music.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt23tmhqvl0prg.jpg><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> Bitcoin: 50 Cent's net worth increases by $8m</p><p class=align-left>While at school, Quavo was quite good at sports of different types. He used to be a quarterback for a school football team. In addition to it, he excelled at basketball and golf. He was raised together with his nephew Kirshnik (aka “Takeoff”) and his cousin Kiari (aka “Offset”). These were his best friends and future mates in the band “Migos”.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/6e9338da795b00ff.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>The only thing I’m afraid of is poverty: Peter Okoye speaks, says he is not scared of death in viral video</span></p></a><p class=align-left>As claimed by Celebrity Net Worth, the “Migos” band is now worth $12 million. How much does each of them possess in this amount?</p><h2>How Quavo net worth started to build up</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/6e9338da795b00ff.jpg><p class=align-left>The trio “Migos”, which is astonishingly popular now, is, actually, Quavo’s brainchild. At first, Quavo recorded a mixtape and tried to pass it around the school but with little success. However, the sound seemed interesting to his cousin Kiari, the “Offset”, and he joined the band. The original name was “Polo Club” but soon it turned into “Migos”, which is almost a trademark today.</p><p class=align-left>The very first mixtape produced by the band, not by Quavo alone, was recorded and released in August 2011. It was titled “Juug Season”. The next one caught up with it very soon. In June 2012, the band released another one known as “No Label”.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkytl7tn69akavc.jpg><p class=align-left>Yet, none of the mixtapes gained much fame until in 2013 when the band hit the charts with their first single titled “Versace”. It was so great that it took a place in Billboard Top 100 without a hint of a promotion. The track was later remixed by Drake.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/01d4d34794f1eec6.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>As you dey help people, dem dey vex: Davido’s PA Isreal reports singer’s haters in funny video, fans react</span></p></a><p class=align-left>After the release of the singles “Versace” and “Hannah Montana” the band was mentioned such publications as Rolling Stone, Complex, XXL, and SPIN magazine.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt3b6tuf13imgg.jpg><p class=align-left>How rich is Quavo at this moment, when “Versace” is in rotation everywhere? Well, it’s easy to imagine that he already had a couple of millions back then. Today, “Versace” music video has been viewed 19 million times. In the USA, it has been sold in 500,000 of copies and received a gold certificate. This is a great deal of one’s net worth, isn’t it?</p><h2>At the top of the popularity</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/01d4d34794f1eec6.jpg><p class=align-left>Since the times of their super successful first singles, Migos have produced a lot more.

It received the 175th place in Billboard Top 200. “Handsome” and “Wealthy” received some rotation but “Flight Night” was an outburst that brought the band the second gold certificate.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/bdd9187eaf1c18a5.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Davido shows off his garage filled with luxury cars, Bentley and Lamborghini spotted in viral video, fans gush</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The “Young Rich Nation” album from 2015 was the first studio album.

Many say that he’s generated the most of the trio’s fame and popularity. Quavo’s social networks are packed with fans and he is the one who’s able to make a fortune out of ad revenue alone. He’s working on his solo career and having live concerts. In 2017 he released his first single titled “Champions” that includes a range of star guest appearances like Kanye West, 2Chains, and others.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/67ef880a8ecec63c.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Video emerges showing Davido looking troubled after appearing to lose lots of money while playing games</span></p></a><p class=align-left>What’s Quavo Marshall net worth 2018? In accordance to Wealtholino, it’s about $4.3 million. Such a calculation is probably based on a belief that he’s one part of the trio and has an equal portion of their mutual success. However, other sources like The NetWorth Portal claim it to be something about $2.5 million or nearly $3 million.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/bdd9187eaf1c18a5.jpg><p class=align-left>In any case, Quavo still has where to grow since he’s only 27 now.

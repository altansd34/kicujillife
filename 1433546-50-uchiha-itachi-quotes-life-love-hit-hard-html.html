That's why we're born to attract other things to make up for what we lack.</li><li>He who forgives and acknowledges himself... that is what it truly means to be strong!</li><li>If you want to know who you are, you have to look at your real self and acknowledge what you see.</li><li>It is foolish to fear what we have yet to see and know.</li><li>Even the strongest of opponents always have a weakness.</li><li>People’s lives don’t end when they die. It ends when they lose faith.</li><li>Self-sacrifice… A nameless shinobi who protects peace within its shadow. That is a true shinobi.</li><li><a href=#>True change</a> cannot be made if it is bound by laws and limitations, predictions and imagination.</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/27859ab9c3df5537.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>25 badass Uchiha Madara quotes every Naruto fan should know</span></p></a><h2>Itachi quotes about pain</h2><p class=align-left>From many Uchiha Itachi quotes, it is evident that he has lived through some painful moments.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/27859ab9c3df5537.png><ul><li>Time doesn’t heal anything, it just teaches us how to live with pain.</li><li>Teachings that do not speak of pain have no meaning, for humankind cannot gain anything in return.</li><li>Pain must be the ultimate lesson, and it teaches one to understand what pain in life actually is. Because those who never understood someone else’s pain will eventually end up knowing nothing.</li><li>Loneliness is this world’s worst kind of pain.</li><li>You’re such a child.

You can get what you need from Itachi's <a href=#>quotes about life</a>.</p><ul><li>People live their lives bound by what they accept as correct and true. That's how they define "reality". But what does it mean to be "correct" or "true"? Merely vague concepts... Their "reality" may all be a mirage. Can we consider them to simply be living in their own world, shaped by their beliefs?</li><li>Knowledge and awareness are vague, and perhaps better called illusions. Everyone lives within their own subjective interpretation.</li><li>I actually don't think something like perfection exists. That is I think why we are born able to absorb things... and by comparing ourselves with something else we can finally head in a good direction.</li><li>Those who turn their hands against their comrades are sure to die a terrible death. Be prepared.</li><li>We do not know what kind of people we truly are until the moment before our deaths. As death comes to embrace you, you will realize what you are.</li><li>One’s reality might be others’ illusion. We all live inside our own fantasies. Thinking Madara is dead is merely an arbitrary assumption that you made. In exactly the same way you once assumed that I was your gentle older brother.</li><li>Those who forgive themselves, and are able to accept their true nature… They are the strong ones!</li><li>However strong you become, never seek to bear everything alone. If you do, failure is certain.</li><li>Your comrades are there to make up for what you cannot do and to prevent you from ignoring things that you actually might have been able to do.</li><li>No matter what darkness or contradictions lie within the village. I am still Itachi Uchiha of the leaf.</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/3276980f4ba2d3ef.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Memorable Naruto quotes from all of your favorite characters</span></p></a><h2>Sad Itachi quotes</h2><p class=align-left>Despite being seen as the strong and ruthless villain in the series, Itachi feels deeply. Here are some of his sad quotes:</p><ul><li>There is no value in killing the likes of you… Foolish little brother, if you wish to kill me, then hate me, detest me, curse me, and survive in an unsightly way. Run, run and cling to your pitiful life.</li><li>If I had been open with you from the start… and looked you straight in the eyes and told you the truth, then I wouldn’t have had to stand before you, from above, as a failure, telling you all of this. I failed.</li><li>The people of this clan are all the same. You focus on the trivial, and lose sight of what’s most important. Change is impossible, in this fog of ignorance. How can we evolve when regulation is all we know?</li><li>My capacity…I’ve lost all hope for this pathetic clan…the clan…the clan…all of you without measuring your own capacities…had no idea of ​​mine…and now, you lie here, defeated…</li><li>Obsessed with organization, obsessed with the clan, obsessed with ourselves. A worthless compulsion that enslaves us and limits our capabilities, leading us to fear what we don’t understand.</li><li>Even if you don’t want your youth to end, dreams must come to an end at some point!</li><li>If you lie to yourself how can you have friends or be trustworthy. In the end, all these lies will keep you from seeing your true self.</li><li>You talk a lot. You don’t understand me. You don’t even understand yourself. You are just thugs who got lost in the mist and ended up here. You can’t even control where you are going.</li><li>The words of a failure making excuses. Are you telling me to admit my limitations and give up?</li><li>You are weak. Why are you so weak? Because you lack that hatred.</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/235ba67697918c2e.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>The best quotes about helping others that will tug at your compassion</span></p></a><h2>Itachi quotes about love</h2><p class=align-left>From the Naruto series, it is apparent that Itachi loved his brother Sasuke deeply.

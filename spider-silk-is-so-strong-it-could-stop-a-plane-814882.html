They make the toughest casters you can find on&nbsp;our planet. The <a href=# title=silk data-link=tag>silk</a> spiders use to&nbsp;build webs is&nbsp;stronger than steel. They trap their prey in&nbsp;that web. They use it&nbsp;to&nbsp;dangle from the ceiling in&nbsp;our homes and haunt our dreams too.</p><p>Their silk is&nbsp;extremely stretchy. Considering how stretchy the silk&nbsp;is, plus the amount of&nbsp;force you need to&nbsp;use to&nbsp;break it&nbsp;— that combination shows the silk is&nbsp;so&nbsp;strong it’s able to&nbsp;take three times as&nbsp;much energy as&nbsp;Kevlar before it&nbsp;breaks.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/c59/c42/cc0d2c525e97f5a1dbc249bcab.png><p>Kevlar is&nbsp;a&nbsp;synthetic material used for tires or&nbsp;some other rubber products like cut-resistance gloves or&nbsp;flame and blast barriers. It’s also a&nbsp;material used for sports gear. For example, it’s the thing in&nbsp;your running shoes that helps you maximize your energy output. With Kevlar, boats are more tolerant of&nbsp;damage and lighter. It’s extremely strong&nbsp;— 5&nbsp;times stronger than steel&nbsp;— and lightweight at&nbsp;the same time.</p><p>Dragline silk is&nbsp;an&nbsp;especially strong kind of&nbsp;spider silk. A&nbsp;dragline connects the spider to&nbsp;its web. It’s something like a&nbsp;safety line in&nbsp;case a&nbsp;spider falls, and it&nbsp;needs to&nbsp;be&nbsp;strong enough to&nbsp;support the weight of&nbsp;the spider. A&nbsp;single strand consists of&nbsp;protein molecules, and they are aligned together really, really tightly. Each strand of&nbsp;spider silk is&nbsp;1000 times thinner than human hair&nbsp;— that’s why you can break it&nbsp;so&nbsp;easily even though it’s really strong.</p><p>But each strand is&nbsp;still stronger than many types of&nbsp;steel. You’d just have to&nbsp;get steel equally thin to&nbsp;truly compare&nbsp;it. Scientists believe that if&nbsp;we&nbsp;could make dragline silk, for instance, as&nbsp;thick as&nbsp;a&nbsp;pencil and 18.6 miles long we’d have material so&nbsp;strong we&nbsp;could stop a&nbsp;jetliner in&nbsp;the middle of&nbsp;the flight. But the passengers probably wouldn’t like&nbsp;it.</p><p>When it’s windy outside and a&nbsp;wind or&nbsp;even just a&nbsp;light breeze catches the spider’s sturdy dragline, it&nbsp;catches air and turns into some kind of&nbsp;an&nbsp;open parachute. That’s when the <a href=# title=adventure data-link=tag>adventure</a> starts for a&nbsp;spider&nbsp;— its dragline bends and stretches further. That way, it&nbsp;can send the spider to&nbsp;“fly” very far away, and it&nbsp;won’t break. And this way, spiders can really fly away hundreds of&nbsp;miles.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/1b3/e3b/5bf50d5bfcaf2e2760a4e3e01a.png><p>Since spider silk is&nbsp;so&nbsp;strong, it&nbsp;inspired researchers to&nbsp;come up&nbsp;with new material. It’s known as&nbsp;something called elastomer since it’s elastic like rubber. This material has a&nbsp;structure just like a&nbsp;spider web and that’s what makes it&nbsp;durable and allows you to&nbsp;evenly distribute the stress you put on&nbsp;it&nbsp;without breaking&nbsp;it. Just like spider silk, it’s both exceptionally tough and stiff.</p><p>Stiff materials can take a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;stress before you manage to&nbsp;deform them, whereas tough materials can absorb a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;energy before you break them. For instance, glass is&nbsp;stiff but not tough. When it&nbsp;comes to&nbsp;commercial materials, it’s mostly a&nbsp;trade-off&nbsp;— with higher stiffness comes lower toughness, and vice versa.</p><p>The fact this new spider silk-inspired material is&nbsp;high in&nbsp;both of&nbsp;these features makes it&nbsp;even cooler! There are more extremely hard materials we’re discovering or&nbsp;even inventing. For example, there’s a&nbsp;new type of&nbsp;glass that’s harder even than diamonds. Diamonds are generally the hardest of&nbsp;all-natural materials.</p><p>But now scientists have made a&nbsp;new type of&nbsp;carbon they named AM-III. It’s now the strongest and hardest amorphous material we&nbsp;know about. Amorphous means the material doesn’t really have apparent organization or&nbsp;shape. For example, rubber, glass, wax, and plastics.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/f7d/63b/46951656a1ad52f8a8ea6f3906.png><p>Diamonds are that strong and durable thanks to&nbsp;their extremely regular structure. You’d think this new material that’s even stronger than that has a&nbsp;structure like a&nbsp;diamond [tetrahedral structure] too&nbsp;— but it’s actually more similar to&nbsp;glass. You may have heard some people believe that glass is&nbsp;a&nbsp;liquid. It’s not, but we&nbsp;can’t really put it&nbsp;in&nbsp;the category of&nbsp;solid materials either. It’s a&nbsp;peculiar amorphous material.</p><p>So&nbsp;the molecules aren’t as&nbsp;disorganized as&nbsp;in&nbsp;a&nbsp;liquid, but they’re not in&nbsp;strict order as&nbsp;you’d see in&nbsp;a&nbsp;solid. AM-III conducts electricity well, but just in&nbsp;some cases. That means we&nbsp;could potentially use it&nbsp;to&nbsp;get, let’s say, solar energy. This material would come in&nbsp;handy for bulletproof windows that are up&nbsp;to&nbsp;100 times tougher than the <a href=# title=technology data-link=tag>technology</a> we&nbsp;currently use.</p><p>Mass production of&nbsp;this material will certainly be&nbsp;expensive, plus we’ll have to&nbsp;wait for researchers to&nbsp;test it&nbsp;more, but this new yellow-tinted glass is&nbsp;definitely a&nbsp;material we&nbsp;might see a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;sometime in&nbsp;the future. The next one is&nbsp;Wurtzite boron nitride. It’s quite weird. It’s harder than diamond&nbsp;— some studies say 18&nbsp;percent harder, which is&nbsp;a&nbsp;lot&nbsp;— AND it’s amorphous at&nbsp;the same time. But the craziest part is&nbsp;that it’s extremely rare because it&nbsp;forms ONLY during volcanic eruptions!</p><p>Then we&nbsp;have Lonsdaleite. Let’s say there’s a&nbsp;meteor full of&nbsp;carbon&nbsp;— that contains a&nbsp;bit of&nbsp;graphite too. It&nbsp;goes through the Earth’s atmosphere and eventually collides with our planet. You probably think a&nbsp;meteor that’s falling toward&nbsp;us is&nbsp;extremely hot. In&nbsp;reality, only its outer layers become hot. The interior of&nbsp;this object remains cool throughout most of&nbsp;its journey toward our planet.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/f56/5e5/c0a59d52c7a75d450274781600.png><p>When this meteorite hits the surface of&nbsp;Earth, the pressure in&nbsp;its interior becomes insanely big. It’s stronger than any other natural process that can affect the shape of&nbsp;graphite or&nbsp;some other material. Like, if&nbsp;you squeeze it&nbsp;or&nbsp;try to&nbsp;shape it&nbsp;with whichever technology you’d want, you still don’t get a&nbsp;force that’s as&nbsp;strong as&nbsp;the pressure that occurs during this impact. Because of&nbsp;this, the graphite in&nbsp;that meteor compresses and now has a&nbsp;crystalline structure.</p><p>It’s not like a&nbsp;diamond, even better&nbsp;— it&nbsp;turns out to&nbsp;be&nbsp;58% harder! But for now, graphite that’s harder than diamond is&nbsp;just a&nbsp;scientific theory. Scientists DO&nbsp;study some real examples of&nbsp;graphite and its different shapes. But they have only those that are not that pure.</p><p>That means there are lots of&nbsp;other elements in&nbsp;these materials that make this material softer than diamonds. But if&nbsp;there was a&nbsp;special pure graphite meteorite heading towards our planet and striking the surface, it&nbsp;would, without any doubt, create material way harder than any diamond we&nbsp;have ever found.</p><p>And how about Dyneema? It’s the strongest fiber in&nbsp;the world, 15&nbsp;times stronger than steel. It’s also nearly 40&nbsp;percent stronger than aramid fibers&nbsp;— for example, Kevlar used for tires, the one we’ve mentioned before. Dyneema is&nbsp;lighter than water but is&nbsp;still great for things like ropes and towing lines for the shipping industry. It’s a&nbsp;great material for nets for fishing and safety gloves in&nbsp;the metalworking field too.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/34a/e4e/e36c5d5f7789c6a8acf3dda073.png><p>Here’s something called Palladium micro-alloy glass. As&nbsp;we’ve said before, there are two very important features all materials have. The first one is&nbsp;strength. That’s how much force some material can withstand before you manage to&nbsp;deform&nbsp;it.</p><p>The second one is&nbsp;toughness. This stands for how much energy you need to&nbsp;fracture or&nbsp;break&nbsp;it. Ceramics are mostly strong, but not very tough. Elastic materials such as&nbsp;rubber can hold a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;energy, but you can deform them relatively easily. And they’re not strong.</p><p>And over a&nbsp;decade, researchers created a&nbsp;new glass with a&nbsp;combination of&nbsp;5&nbsp;elements [silicon, phosphorous, silver, germanium, and palladium] that ended up&nbsp;as&nbsp;a&nbsp;material that’s stronger than all types of&nbsp;steel. Yup, this glass will rather deform than break.</p><p>This is&nbsp;actually the hardest material that doesn’t include carbon. And, meet buckypaper! In&nbsp;the late 20th century we&nbsp;discovered there’s a&nbsp;specific form of&nbsp;carbon that’s, once again, harder than diamonds. It’s called carbon nanotubes.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/37c/418/bb61cb5d3ab9b5301be8d47b61.png><p>If&nbsp;we&nbsp;bind carbon into a&nbsp;different shape than diamond, we&nbsp;get a&nbsp;structure that’s way more stable than any other we&nbsp;know about. And putting these carbon nanotubes together, you create buckypaper, which is&nbsp;basically an&nbsp;incredibly strong, but also a&nbsp;very, very thin sheet.</p><p>It&nbsp;holds just 10&nbsp;percent of&nbsp;the weight of&nbsp;steel, but at&nbsp;the same time, it’s hundreds of&nbsp;times stronger. Buckypaper is&nbsp;also fireproof. Well, that could make a&nbsp;very cool bucky paper airplane! Have they thought about that use?</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZMCxtcOeqWarmaG4brXSZqqoZaOpv7C6xmagrWWTpMKtsIysq6ioXZZ6sbjAp5xmcGFphXl%2Bjg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

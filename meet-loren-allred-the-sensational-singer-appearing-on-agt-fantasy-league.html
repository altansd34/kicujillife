Her exceptional talent was evident from an early age, leading her to pursue a career in musical theater. After a year of studying musical theater at Weber State University in Ogden, Utah, she transferred to the prestigious Berklee College of Music in Boston, Massachusetts.</p><p>While in Boston, Loren uploaded videos of her singing to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">YouTube</a>, catching the attention of renowned singer and producer Ne-Yo. Impressed by her talent, Ne-Yo championed her cause, ultimately leading to a record deal with Island Def Jam. This marked the beginning of Loren’s professional music career, opening doors to opportunities that would showcase her extraordinary vocal abilities.</p><p>Loren wowed the judges and audience with her incredible talent on Season 15 of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Britain’s Got Talent</a> in 2022. Her stunning rendition of “Never Enough” during her audition earned her high praise from the judges and a Golden Buzzer from Amanda Holden, propelling her straight to the semifinals.</p><p>Loren continued to impress with a soulful performance of “You Say” by Lauren Daigle, securing her spot in the final.

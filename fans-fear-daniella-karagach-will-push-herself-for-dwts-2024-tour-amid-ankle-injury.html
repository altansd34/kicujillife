This situation has understandably led Karagach to take time off of the tour. She will not be appearing in the tour’s first month in 2024.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-daniella-karagach-pulls-out-of-dwts-2024-tour-for-a-month>Daniella Karagach Pulls Out of ‘DWTS’ 2024 Tour for a Month</h2><p>On Wednesday, December 13, Karagach took to her Instagram stories to explain her decision. Within her post, she explained that she’s on the road to recovery.</p><p>“Hi everyone! I just wanted to give you a little update. As you have probably seen, I’m injured,” she wrote. “I’m so excited for this tour and want to make sure I give it my all every time on stage. In order to do that, I have to heal properly before going on the road.”</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Update from Daniella! <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/KeObLYVG2H</a></p>— Averi (@mrazxdwts) <a href=#>December 14, 2023</a><p>In Karagach’s place, DWTS troupe member Alexis Warr will be taking her place. At this time, Karagach has announced that she’ll join the tour in early February. Ahead of this decision, fans wondered if it would be safe for Karagach to tour, given the injury.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-daniella-karagach-had-to-numb-her-ankles-to-perform-in-the-dwts-season-32-finale>Daniella Karagach Had to Numb Her Ankles to Perform in the DWTS Season 32 Finale</h2><p>The <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">professional choreographer</a> and her DWTS season 32 partner, Jason Mraz, placed second in the Finale. Apparently though, behind their excellent ballroom routine was a suffering yet uncomplaining Karagach. In an Instagram Story post, the pro revealed that she had to get a shot to relieve the pain of her ankles ahead of their performance.</p><p>“If you know me, you know I’m deathly afraid of needles. I couldn’t stand the pain and Dr. Z came through and gave me some shots to numb my ankles. It was the only way I could get through the finale,” she wrote.</p><a href=# class=broken_link>Dani was seriously injured on the finale</a><br>by<a href=# class=broken_link>u/fashionenzo</a> in<a href=# class=broken_link>dancingwiththestars</a><p>Despite an amazing stint on the show, it’s no secret that the DWTS pro has been dealing with intense physical pain throughout the season. Karagach kept her followers updated regarding her healing, sharing some glimpses of her doctor appointments.</p><p>In a December 9 Instagram Story post, Karagach shared that she had to undergo Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) for her ankles. The season 30 Mirrorball Trophy winner then shared a picture of her feet in medical boots.</p><p>“This season was craaaaazzzyyyyyy when it came to injuries,” she wrote. “I heard when breastfeeding your hormones are out of wack and you are more susceptible to injury. From spraining my ankle week 5 to dislocating my thumb last week and also flaring up my ankles it was a gnarly season for me. I’m super grateful to the Dr’s who saw me and to DWTS for always making sure I was always taken care of.”</p><p>As a professional dancer, Karagach is no stranger to injuries. In 2022, she revealed that she endured a broken ankle while on tour.

His listed height is 1.87m (6'2"), and his weight is 67kg.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/d1d1f340634dd566.jpeg><h2>Who are Destiny Udogie's parents?</h2><p class=align-left>The footballer's parents, Franklin (father) and Kate (mother) are from Ehor, Edo, Nigeria. Destiny has two siblings: a brother and a sister. In an interview in July 2023 with <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Football.London,</a> Destiny talks about his family, stating:</p>My mother discovered my passion for football because when I was a baby, I was kicking everything I saw around the house. Obviously after all, my family was behind me. My father pushed me a lot. Everybody, my father, my sister, my mum. All of them.<h2>Destiny Udogie's career</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/720/6c637968ba0c63e4.jpeg><p class=align-left>Udogie started his football career in the youth system of Hellas Verona and made his Serie A debut in a 2-2 draw against Milan on November 8, 2020. Udogie signed a season-long loan with Udinese, which included a buyout clause, on July 15, 2021. He made 37 appearances<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> for Udinese</a> in his debut season, mainly as a left wingback, and scored five goals.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/ffd9346938461d30.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Who is Aliou Cisse, Senegal's head coach for the World Cup?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Spurs officials confirmed Udogie's signing with a permanent transfer deal that runs through 2027 on August 16, 2022. For the 2022–23 season, Udogie was sent back on loan to Udinese in an unusual arrangement. On August 13, 2023, in the first match of the 2023–24 Premier League season, Udogie made his Tottenham debut as a starter away to Brentford.</p><h3>International career</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/720/bd3216ca765c321f.jpeg><p class=align-left>Udogie was born in Italy, but his family is from Nigeria. He has also played youth international football for Italy. His debut with the Italy U21 squad on September 3, 2021, was significant in his career. His performance as a starter in a qualifying match was instrumental in a 3-0 win over Luxembourg.</p><h3>Destiny Udogie's contract and transfer</h3><p class=align-left>To secure his place in Tottenham Hotspur's <a href=#>future</a>, the north London club has signed the Italian defender to a long-term contract. Tottenham has announced a record-breaking new deal keeping Destiny with the club until 2030.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/7c1eca35ab317f88.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=33><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Fabinho's wife, age, salary, contract, house, achievements, net worth in 2024</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The 21-year-old has been sensational so far this Premier League season, and he scored the game-winning goal in a 4-1 triumph over Newcastle United. He has now committed to Ange Postecoglou and the Spurs for the long haul, signing a six-year deal with an additional year's option.</p><p class=align-left>Although he was officially signed in the summer of 2022, Udogie spent the season on loan with Serie A side Udinese, where he established himself as a mainstay at left wing-back and made a strong case for a call-up to the Italian national team. That came this past season (2023–24) after he quickly adapted to the Premier League and excelled as a left-back with the freedom to play inside as Tottenham's number 10 under Postecoglou.</p><p class=align-left>Except for one match missed due to injury and another due to a two-game suspension following a red card and two yellow cards received against Chelsea, he has started every game in the Premier League this season, scoring once and assisting on another.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/625836c99da2adbe.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>What is Andrew Tate's kickboxing record?

Throughout their 21 matches, he has created every one of these 18 appearances.</p><p class=align-left>Destiny last played a full 90 minutes for Tottenham Hotspur in a 2-2 draw with Manchester United on January 14. That was his last Premier League appearance. This season, the defender has contributed to one goal and two assists in the Premier League. He has one red card and five yellow cards.</p><p class=align-left>In 33 appearances for Udinese in the Serie A last season, he netted three goals and set up four more. After spending time<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> on loan at Udinese</a> (where he made 68 league appearances, scored eight goals, and assisted eight more), he returned to Tottenham Hotspur in July 2023.</p><h3>Destiny Udogie's injury and bookings</h3><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/9d9d8111ae8bfa1b.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Destiny Udogie parents, brother, age, height, is he a Nigerian?</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/720/9af9f684dc7e7477.jpeg><p class=align-left>Another injury worry for Tottenham is Destiny, who has pulled out of the Italy squad. The Tottenham left-back was <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">pulled out</a> of the Italy squad due to his ongoing struggle with a sustained muscle injury against Fulham. Udogie, who is twenty years old, was substituted out of the 2-0 triumph over Cottagers and lost the match against Crystal Palace.</p><p class=align-left>Despite not having much time to prepare, the left-back was called into action for Spurs' 4-1 loss to Chelsea. He had a rough game and was sent off for two bookings. He was suspended for Saturday's 2-1 loss to Wolves and withdrew from Italy's pivotal Euro 2024 qualifiers against North Macedonia and Ukraine.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/7c1eca35ab317f88.jpeg><h3>Is Destiny Udogie playing in AFCON?</h3><p class=align-left>The prospect of Destiny (aged 21) representing Nigeria at the U-23 or senior level appears dim in the light of FIFA regulations.

He earns an average <a href=#>salary</a> of $280,000 and ranks among the Premier League's best left-backs.</p><h2>Final word</h2><p class=align-left>Because of his extraordinary skill, Destiny stood out. Even though he was born in Italy, Destiny Udogie's parents have ties to <a href=#>Africa</a> since they are from Nigeria.

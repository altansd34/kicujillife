Shakira and Piqu√©</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/25e/542/64934e5d119579f25051b1de28.jpg><p>The famous couple, who currently have 2&nbsp;children named Sasha and Milan, <a href=#>met</a> during the shooting of&nbsp;the music video for <a href=# title=Shakira data-link=tag>Shakira</a>‚Äôs hit song Waka Waka (This Time for Africa). During the recording, the crush that Gerard Piqu√© had for his now wife was so&nbsp;strong that he&nbsp;did everything to&nbsp;be&nbsp;with her. Both are still very much in&nbsp;<a href=# title=love data-link=tag>love</a> to&nbsp;this day.</p><p><h2>2. Britney Spears and Sam Asghari</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f8a/1a8/1a4194563b82c0aac65c757e74.jpg><p>The way Sam Asghari reached out to&nbsp;Pop Queen <a href=# title="Britney Spears" data-link=tag>Britney Spears</a> was kind of&nbsp;<a href=#>embarrassing</a>... Or&nbsp;at&nbsp;least that‚Äôs what he&nbsp;confessed to&nbsp;the media. They were working together on&nbsp;the shooting for the Slumber Party music video. Spears came to&nbsp;him to&nbsp;introduce herself and because he&nbsp;was so&nbsp;nervous, he&nbsp;pretended to&nbsp;not know who she was just to&nbsp;make her laugh.</p><p><h2>3. Joe Jonas and Camilla Belle</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ec4/f3f/b80de050b99d65adff7b61d2d9.jpg><p>Joe Jonas and Camilla Belle <a href=#>fell in&nbsp;love</a> at&nbsp;first sight while they were working together on&nbsp;set.

They were together for a&nbsp;year, from 2008 to&nbsp;2009, and had a&nbsp;beautiful relationship.</p><p><h2>4. Colson Baker and Megan Fox</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d57/d3d/a3e2f45bbb9fb43f870b5c0237.jpg><p>Rapper Colson Baker (Machine Gun Kelly) and actress <a href=# title="Megan Fox" data-link=tag>Megan Fox</a>, confirmed they were in&nbsp;a&nbsp;relationship after <a href=#>rumors</a> arose when they were working together on&nbsp;the music video of&nbsp;the song Bloody Valentine. Fox must have really felt attracted to&nbsp;Baker when they met. Let‚Äôs not forget that she was just coming out of&nbsp;a&nbsp;very serious relationship with ex-husband Austin Green. But still, she decided to&nbsp;give it&nbsp;a&nbsp;shot and get into a&nbsp;new committed relationship with the rapper.</p><p><h2>5. Justin Bieber and Jasmine Villegas</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/294/27f/9fac455d9eb00fd710a89ba940.jpg><p>When <a href=# title="Justin Bieber" data-link=tag>Justin Bieber</a> was still the teenager most of&nbsp;us remember him&nbsp;as, he&nbsp;started a&nbsp;relationship with Jasmine Villegas. The couple <a href=#>met</a> while shooting the music video for the now modern classic pop hit Baby. Their relationship was actually kept secret for a&nbsp;while. It&nbsp;was not until they showed their love in&nbsp;public months later that rumors were confirmed. However, the relationship didn‚Äôt last much more than a&nbsp;few months.</p><p><h2>6. Pen√©lope Cruz and Nacho Cano</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d3c/36d/b1ef6f527aa579ffcbd553b7a6.jpg><p>Although it&nbsp;has been quite some time since these 2&nbsp;hit the front pages of&nbsp;every magazine, Pen√©lope Cruz and singer Nacho Cano seem to&nbsp;not forget the special connection they had when they first met. They <a href=#>were</a> on&nbsp;the set of&nbsp;the shooting of&nbsp;the music video for La&nbsp;Fuerza del Destino, one of&nbsp;Cano‚Äôs greatest hits with the band Mecano. At&nbsp;that time, the famous Spanish actress was still in&nbsp;her teens, yet she didn‚Äôt hesitate to&nbsp;start her first relationship, which ended up&nbsp;lasting 6&nbsp;years, until 1995.</p><p><h2>7. Enrique Iglesias and Anna Kournikova</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/64a/23c/0917f253d1a632b9f8e0e708d7.jpg><p>Enrique Iglesias and tennis player Anna Kournikova <a href=#>fell in&nbsp;love</a> during the shooting of&nbsp;the music video for the song ‚ÄúEscape,‚Äù in&nbsp;2001.

Maluma and Natalia Barul√≠ch</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/6fc/7fc/cac55a5cc98ebe1ebe5c0cbdbf.jpg><p><a href=#>Maluma</a> and Natalia Barul√≠ch became so&nbsp;close after they fell for each other while recording the video clip of&nbsp;<a href=#>Felices los 4</a>&nbsp;that there was no&nbsp;way to&nbsp;catch them on&nbsp;their own for a&nbsp;while. Since that recording, the spark between them was so&nbsp;clear that they went on&nbsp;and made their relationship official. Then after 2&nbsp;years, they decided to&nbsp;end their relationship.</p><p>Have you ever fell for someone you worked with as&nbsp;well? Let&nbsp;us know in&nbsp;the comments!

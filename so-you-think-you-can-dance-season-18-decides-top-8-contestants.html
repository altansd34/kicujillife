It’s been a few weeks since auditions ended and the competition was narrowed down to the Top 10. Two contestants were eliminated on Monday’s show.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-so-you-think-you-can-dance-season-18-decides-top-8>So You Think You Can Dance Season 18 Decides Top 8</h2><p>This week’s episode marked JoJo Siwa’s debut as a judge this season, alongside Maksim Chmerkovskiy and Allison Holker. During the show, the Top 10 found out that they would be moving in together. For their first challenge, they were split into two groups to perform music video routines.</p><p>Based on their performances in the music video challenge, the judges chose six safe contestants. The remaining four contestants had to dance one more time for a chance to move on. Those four dancers were Easton Magliarditi, Avery Gay, Braylon Browner, and Olivia Alboher.</p><p>After watching these dancers’ solo performances, the judges decided to eliminate Olivia and Avery. That means that the Top 8 dancers this season are Anthony Curley, Braylon Browner, Dakayla Wilson, Easton Magliarditi, Jaylin Sanders, Madison Rouge Alvarado, Mariyah Hawkins, and Roman Nevinchanyi.</p><p>Those dancers will move on to next week’s show, which will feature a Broadway challenge. The competition will once again be narrowed down as we get closer and closer to crowning a Season 18 winner.</p><p class=has-text-align-left><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">‘SO YOU THINK YOU CAN DANCE’ DECIDES THE TOP 10 IN CHOREOGRAPHY ROUND</a></strong></p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Congratulations to <a href=#>#SYTYCD</a> Season 18 TOP 8!<br>✨Anthony<br>✨Braylon<br>✨Dakayla<br>✨Easton<br>✨Jaylin<br>✨Madison<br>✨Mariyah<br>✨Roman</p>— So You Think You Can Dance (@DANCEonFOX) <a href=#>April 16, 2024</a><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-what-do-fans-think-of-this-season>What Do Fans Think of This Season?</h2><p>So You Think You Can Dance fans on social media have been vocal about their dislike of this season’s format. Whereas fans used to be able to vote for their favorite dancers, the results are now decided solely by the judges.</p><p>As <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">one fan wrote</a> in response to the Top 8 announcement, “Remember when viewers had a voice and there was a reason to be invested in this show? Miss those days…”</p><p>Another <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">fan wrote</a> of the current season: “I find the new format quite disappointing. It feels like I’m watching a show where the judges are more focused on being on camera than on the essence of the content. It’s as if the charm and authenticity have been lost.”</p><p>What do you think of the new format? Should viewers be able to vote for their favorite dancers?

Both are key to developing a successful </span><span>crisis management plan</span><span>, but there are a few differences worth noting.</span></p><p><b>Brand monitoring</b><span> involves collecting and measuring mentions of an organization across various channels: Think monitoring social media platforms, news outlets and other online channels to track what people are saying about your brand. Companies typically convert these findings into actionable insights.</span></p><p><a href=#><b>Brand tracking</b></a><span> involves regularly measuring and analyzing brand performance over time via metrics such as brand awareness, customer loyalty and brand sentiment. Brand tracking helps business leaders measure brand performance compared with competitors, identify trends in brand perception and make data-driven decisions about brand strategy.</span></p><p><span>Both brand tracking and brand monitoring are crucial to informing your </span><span>crisis management plan</span><span> and overall </span><span>business continuity</span><span> strategy, yet leveraging brand tracking specifically can truly transform your crisis management strategy.</span><span><br></span><span><br></span><i><span>Looking for a complete guide to brand tracking?

To recap: Nike’s “Dream Crazy” campaign featuring the former San Francisco 49ers quarterback won Outstanding Commercial at the Creative Arts Emmy Awards. However, the campaign also sparked nationwide controversy because Kaepernick had chosen not to stand for the national anthem during an NFL preseason game in 2016.</span></p><p><span>Utilizing </span><a href=#><span>Morning Consult</span></a><span> data and visualizations, we were able to monitor metrics related to this campaign in real time through our advanced dashboards, including:</span></p><ul><li aria-level=1><span>A</span> <b>Trended Response Options </b><span>c</span><span>hart displaying a longitudinal view of Nike’s favorability.

The backlash was immediate across news and social channels, with Facebook issuing a public apology a few days later.</span></p><p><a href=#><span>Morning Consult’s Brand Intelligence</span></a><span> was able to show changes in favorability in the period immediately after the story broke, highlighting one of the pitfalls of relying solely on top-of-the-funnel metrics to determine the severity of a crisis. Our </span><span>crisis management</span><span> insights revealed that:</span></p><ul><li aria-level=1><span>Within days, the story had spread like wildfire, making it crucial for Facebook to respond. Our Trended Response Comparison chart — showing daily data for negative buzz — revealed that within three days of the report, awareness had already ticked up to more than a third of the U.S. population.</span></li><li aria-level=1><span>By March 25, negative buzz had increased to the point that more than half of U.S. adults were aware of negative news about Facebook. It was at this point that the brand began running full-page ads in many newspapers around the world to apologize for the event.</span></li><li aria-level=1><span>By leveraging Morning Consult’s proprietary data, we observed that Facebook’s investors lost more trust in the company because of the Cambridge Analytica story compared with the general population.</span></li></ul><p><a href=# rel=noopener><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/assets.morningconsult.com/wp-uploads/2023/03/03214410/Morning-Consult-Visa-Case-Study-Desktop-Wide.png alt="Morning Consult Visa case study download" width=1800 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 1800px) 100vw, 1800px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiln6e7qrrGnKanq6WhwW%2BvzqZma2hiaHxxf45pamign6x6o77Ap5tmrKKWsKy1zaBkoqWgp7y3sdJmmquho57AbrnAp5ignZ2au7V7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

The laws are different. A job in Barcelona won’t have the same holiday pay rules as a job in Manchester, even if you are employed by UK companies in Spain. Still, jobs in Spain are rewarding because the <a href=#>best way to learn Spanish</a> is by immersion. So prepare for your Spanish immersion experience by learning the Spanish work laws. Here are the basics of holiday pay in Spain.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Holiday pay in Spain</strong></h2><p>Have you read our <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">tips for moving to Spain</a> already? If so, you’ve considered your visa, insurance, and other official paperwork. Last week we learned about sick pay in Spain. This week, we will focus on holiday pay and the rights of UK citizen working in Spain.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Qualifications for holiday pay in Spain</strong></h3><p>Spain, as part of the EU, has paid holiday coverage. This means that full-time and part-time workers are entitled to a number of paid days off each year to use as they please.&nbsp;</p><p>Non-holiday related paid leave is available for major life events such as maternity/paternity leave at birth, marriage, moving house, jury duty, breastfeeding, and illness. These should not reduce the holiday allotment.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>FAQ about holiday pay in Spain</strong></h2><p>Here are some frequently asked questions (FAQ) about holiday pay in Spain. Remember to check this information with your specific employer.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>How many days off or holidays are you entitled to in Spain?</strong></h3><p>Full-time employees in Spain get a minimum of 22 working days (30 consecutive calendar days including weekends) per year. One holiday period must be two weeks long at least. This is often compulsory, set during winter. The rest can be divided up as you please.&nbsp;</p><p>Workers also have the right to leave on all ten <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Spanish national holidays</a> each year. In most regions of Spain there are additional local holidays, which you are entitled to as well.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Is paid sick leave better in the UK or Spain?</strong></h3><p>It depends. According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">USA Today</a>, Spain is among the most generous EU countries when it comes to holiday pay (along with France, Italy, Portugal, Germany, and Austria). The UK gets 28 holidays with 8 public (bank) holidays. Spain gets only 22 days of paid leave but has 10-18 public holidays per region. That often adds up to more paid time off in Spain.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>How much holiday pay will I receive?</strong></h3><p>You are entitled to 100% of your salary. On holidays, you will receive the same full-pay amount as a normal work day. This includes outstanding salary components linked to performance.</p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">How to prepare to move to Spain</a></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>How long do I have to use holiday pay in Spain?</strong></h3><p>Your annual holiday time must be taken in the year it is accrued. You have until 15 January to use it or it will be lost. There are legal circumstances with further leniency on that timeline, such as when annual holiday and sick leave happened at the same time.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Do employers legally have to pay holiday pay?</strong></h3><p>Yes. The holiday pay laws in Spain are governed by EU regulations. The European Commission publishes guides to temporary incapacity in Spain on their <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Employment, Social Affairs & Inclusion website</a>.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Useful vocabulary for holiday pay in Spain</strong></h3><p>To talk to your boss about holiday, brush up on your <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Spanish days of the week</a>. Here is more useful vocabulary for conversations about paid holiday leave in Spain.</p><ul><li>vacaciones – holiday/vacation</li><li>viajar – to travel</li><li>vuelo – flight</li><li>ida y vuelta – return trip (literally “go and come back”)</li><li>año nuevo – new year</li><li>fiesta – festival/holiday</li><li>día libre/ día de descanso/ día feriado – day off</li><li>el sueldo – salary (typically EUR/month in Spain)</li><li>pedir permiso – to ask permission</li><li>permisos retrubuidos/pagados – paid leave</li></ul><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Learn Spanish for work</strong></h2><p>Obviously, you can best navigate any issue of holiday pay in Spain by learning Spanish.

In print, The Washington Post put the story below the fold on its front page one day after Carroll published her essay, and the news was <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>absent</a> from the covers of major newspapers such as The Wall Street Journal, The Los Angeles Times and The New York Times, which led their papers with news on tensions with Iran.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Dean Baquet, the executive editor of The New York Times, later <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>told his paper that it</a> was “overly cautious” about Carroll’s allegations. And in the week after Carroll published her account in New York Magazine, the New York Times reported an <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>interview</a> with two of her friends attempting to corroborate her story, featuring it on The Daily — one of the top podcasts in the U.S.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Other allegations against prominent people in the public eye — including those raised against Supreme Court <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>Justice Brett Kavanaugh</a> amid his confirmation hearings last September and former <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>Sen. Al Franken</a> (D-Minn.) and Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore of Alabama in 2017 — were at least twice as likely to trickle down to voters.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Christina Bellantoni, former assistant managing editor of politics at the Los Angeles Times, said the reach of Carroll’s story was comparatively limited by the mechanics of how she released it: a first-person essay without the deep corroborating reporting that accompanied some of the other poignant stories of the #MeToo era or a made-for-television moment that could stop the public — and its elected representatives — in their tracks.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">“Her magazine piece was beautifully written and heart wrenching,” said Bellantoni, now director of the Annenberg Media Center at the University of Southern California. “She didn't come out at a press conference with Gloria Allred or in a beautifully lit ‘60 Minutes’ interview.”&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Despite the lack of coverage of the allegations, Leeds said the stories hold political consequences for Trump, adding fuel to the Democratic Party’s base, who have been more likely to hear about allegations against the president than the overall population.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">"I think people care,” she said. “There is fatigue in general, but on the other hand, people are getting mobilized.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiooqR7rrvRp6Cnn5Oku7TBy61lnKedZK6zwMico56rX5a5rbHGmquip56oerCyjKycsa2RoXqutdKcpqecpZjBbq3GmqCnq6RiwbPBzKlkpZminLKtxYyfmKWkXaS7brDEmp1mnZGnwA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

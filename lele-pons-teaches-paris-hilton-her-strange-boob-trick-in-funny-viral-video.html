Nobody could have predicted that they would develop such a strong bond that they are now inseparable and refer to one another as “sisters.”</p><p>Since then, they have appeared in several Instagram posts where they enjoy joyful times with one another. In their most recent post together, Pons teaches Hilton how she moves her chest while laughing, but the businesswoman is unable to do it despite her best efforts.</p><p>“Showing Paris Hilton the boob trick,” the Venezuelan wrote in the description of the Instagram image, which earned hundreds of likes and comments from those who were amused by her unusual <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">dance style</a>. In the background, you can hear Hilton’s song “Stars Are Blind,” which she just sang alongside <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Miley Cyrus</a> in a surprising fashion at her New Year’s Eve event.</p><p>“I tried, love you sis!” Paris Hilton replied in the comments, followed by comments from her followers who assured her it was the funniest thing she had ever done and that her face was hilarious at the failed attempt.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Lele Pons Shares an Inside Look into her Upcoming Wedding</h2><p>The <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">singer</a> began the tedious task of distributing people to their seats and tables for the reception. According to the color-coded map, the wedding will be massive, with hundreds of people spread across 24 tables. A noticeable feature of the ceremony is that it is complete with two bars for the guests to enjoy.</p><p>Juanpa Zurita, one of Pons’ closest friend, is among the first confirmed wedding guests. Zurita will be accompanied by his wife, actress and model, Macarena Achaga. Pons, who had her wedding dress made in Paris, was excited to show them their particular table, and she facetimed them soon she was done her with her map.</p><p>Many of her famous friends, including the bridal party, will attend the exclusive ceremony. Pons announced her bridesmaids shortly after rapper Guaynaa proposed to her. The bridesmaids are Hilton, Anitta, Kimberly Loiza, Hanna Stocking, Isabela Grutman, Nicole Garcia, and Isadora Figueroa.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Original_BirKhalsa_Trae-Patton_NBC-220x147.jpg alt="‘AGT All-Stars’ Contestant Bir Khalsa Group Takes Dangerous Act to the Extreme" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57y56jnmWgpLu0edOemJyglah6sa3RoqpmoJmhwbC6jKGcq2Wjqb%2BiusaeZJunn5d6tb7InKJmoZ5is7a6zbJkr6GilrluwsidnKhn</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

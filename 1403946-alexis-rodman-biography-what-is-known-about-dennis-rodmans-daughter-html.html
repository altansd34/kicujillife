She, in turn, turned on her mother and blamed her for divorcing her dad. It was reported back in 1997 that Caitlin was receiving counseling for anger management. Her mum had this to say about her antics:</p>She shows a lot of anger right now and she is holding it against me that I left Dennis. She also keeps saying to kids at school: `My daddy has girlfriends,' and, `My daddy doesn't come to see me.'

They partially consist of&nbsp;reflective, sparkly, water ice, and you can’t see anything like that in&nbsp;the rest of&nbsp;our Solar System. <a href=# title=Jupiter data-link=tag>Jupiter</a>, Uranus, and Neptune have ring systems, too, and those most likely consist of&nbsp;dust and rocky particles. And not just planets&nbsp;— astronomers found out rings were around one asteroid [Chariklo] as&nbsp;well.</p><p>Speaking of&nbsp;rings, why do&nbsp;you think the <a href=# title=Earth data-link=tag>Earth</a> doesn’t have them? Gas giants [Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune] have rings, while the rocky ones [Mercury, Venus, Earth, and <a href=# title=Mars data-link=tag>Mars</a>] don’t. Two theories explain how rings form. They could be&nbsp;remains from the times when planets were forming. Or&nbsp;they could be&nbsp;leftover material of&nbsp;an&nbsp;impact that destroyed an&nbsp;unknown <a href=# title=moon data-link=tag>moon</a>&nbsp;— or&nbsp;gravity broke apart this moon of&nbsp;its parent planet.</p><p>It’s not clear why only the gas planets have rings. They formed in&nbsp;the outer area of&nbsp;our Solar System, while rocky planets&nbsp;— only in&nbsp;its inner circles&nbsp;— may be&nbsp;a&nbsp;good clue. Maybe these inner rocky planets just had better protection from strong impacts that could have formed rings. Also, there are more moons in&nbsp;the outer Solar System. And there are more rings there.</p><p>Another thing may be&nbsp;that bigger planets have a&nbsp;bigger volume, so&nbsp;a&nbsp;ring system can remain stable there. Some theories even say the Earth used to&nbsp;have a&nbsp;ring system. A&nbsp;long, long time ago, our planet collided with a&nbsp;Mars-sized object, which most likely resulted in&nbsp;a&nbsp;dense ring of&nbsp;particles and debris. But, our story was a&nbsp;bit different than the outer planets&nbsp;— and those rings probably combined and formed the Moon.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/282/7bb/79aff25e098998593b302bb638.png><p>Do&nbsp;we&nbsp;know the shape of&nbsp;the Universe? Einstein had a&nbsp;theory of&nbsp;General Relativity. It&nbsp;said the Universe could be&nbsp;in&nbsp;one of&nbsp;these three forms: closed like a&nbsp;sphere, open like a&nbsp;saddle, or&nbsp;flat like a&nbsp;piece of&nbsp;paper. Its shape determines whether it’s infinite or&nbsp;not and whether it&nbsp;will expand forever or&nbsp;maybe collapse at&nbsp;some point. The shape of&nbsp;the Universe depends on&nbsp;its density and rate of&nbsp;expansion.<strong></strong></p><p>One of&nbsp;the best ways to&nbsp;determine its shape is&nbsp;to&nbsp;use something called the cosmic microwave background (CMB). It’s the relic afterglow, something that’s left of&nbsp;the Big Bang. Sound waves that were moving through the Universe in&nbsp;its early stages produced quite small spatial variations in&nbsp;the temperature of&nbsp;its faint light. The results of&nbsp;the studies showed that the Universe probably expands in&nbsp;all directions, which means it’s flat.</p><p>How come our Sun is&nbsp;hot while the Moon is&nbsp;cold? The Sun gives off heat because its core is&nbsp;extremely hot. In&nbsp;there, the pressure is&nbsp;pretty high, and hydrogen turns into helium. That’s how the Sun creates light and heat. The solar light and heat are enough to&nbsp;light up&nbsp;our days on&nbsp;Earth as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;support life here, even though the Sun is&nbsp;around 93&nbsp;million miles away from&nbsp;us.<strong></strong></p><p>The Moon is&nbsp;not hot because it&nbsp;doesn’t have an&nbsp;atmosphere, so&nbsp;it&nbsp;can’t absorb sunlight as&nbsp;our planet does. Its surface gets very hot in&nbsp;the daytime, about 210 °F.&nbsp;But since there’s no&nbsp;atmosphere, the temperature drops extremely during the night to −279 °F.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/acc/6d3/ea5768590e8435c0ac03bd5cba.png><p>The Sun is&nbsp;hot, no&nbsp;doubt there, but the <a href=# title=space data-link=tag>space</a> around it&nbsp;is&nbsp;very cold. Heat is&nbsp;the energy objects store inside of&nbsp;it. Temperature is&nbsp;how we&nbsp;measure if&nbsp;something is&nbsp;hot or&nbsp;cold. So&nbsp;when you transfer heat to&nbsp;certain objects, its temperature goes&nbsp;up. Take it&nbsp;away, and the temperatures go&nbsp;down.</p><p>You can transfer heat in&nbsp;three different ways&nbsp;— convention, conduction, and radiation. Convention works within gases and liquids, and conduction is&nbsp;for solids. The temperature only affects matter. Space doesn’t have enough particles. It’s nearly a&nbsp;complete vacuum, which means transferring heat is&nbsp;not effective. The only way to&nbsp;do&nbsp;it&nbsp;is&nbsp;through radiation.</p><p>When the heat coming from the Sun falls on&nbsp;an&nbsp;object in&nbsp;the form of&nbsp;radiation, the atoms that make up&nbsp;that object will absorb energy. This energy moves the atoms and makes them produce heat throughout this process. In&nbsp;space, the temperature of&nbsp;the objects stays the same for a&nbsp;long time. Cold objects stay cold, and hot ones stay hot.</p><p>If&nbsp;you place anything outside of&nbsp;the Earth’s atmosphere and expose it&nbsp;to&nbsp;direct sunlight, the Sun will heat it&nbsp;to&nbsp;about 250 °F.&nbsp;Objects in&nbsp;outer space that surround our planet and don’t receive sunlight directly are at&nbsp;50&nbsp;°F.&nbsp;The temperature is&nbsp;like this because there are molecules that escape our atmosphere, so&nbsp;the Sun heats them.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/7b2/0f9/b2726851609eea7d11650c3cf6.png><p>We&nbsp;used to&nbsp;think the water was really rare in&nbsp;space. But now we&nbsp;know there’s water ice across our entire Solar System. For starters, you can usually find water on&nbsp;asteroids and comets. It’s also in&nbsp;craters on&nbsp;Mercury and the Moon that are in&nbsp;permanent shadows. On&nbsp;Mars, you’d find ice at&nbsp;its poles, under the surface dust, and in&nbsp;frost. It&nbsp;might not be&nbsp;enough to&nbsp;support human colonies up&nbsp;there, but it’s still something.</p><p>Some other bodies in&nbsp;our Solar System also contain ice, like the dwarf planet Ceres and one of&nbsp;Saturn’s moons [Enceladus]. Europa, one of&nbsp;Jupiter’s moons, could be&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the most likely candidates we&nbsp;know about that could contain life. It&nbsp;probably has an&nbsp;entire ocean under its frozen and cracked surface. It&nbsp;could have twice as&nbsp;much water as&nbsp;all oceans on&nbsp;our planet together.</p><p>Titan, the biggest of&nbsp;Saturn’s moons, also has a&nbsp;liquid cycle, but it’s not water. Its cycle moves materials between the surface and the atmosphere. At&nbsp;first, it&nbsp;sounds like the water cycle we&nbsp;have on&nbsp;Earth. But immense lakes on&nbsp;Titan are filled with ethane and methane. There’s a&nbsp;chance they’re over a&nbsp;layer of&nbsp;water. Neptune is&nbsp;about 30&nbsp;times as&nbsp;far from the Sun as&nbsp;we&nbsp;are. Of&nbsp;course, it&nbsp;gets significantly less light and heat than Earth. But it&nbsp;also radiates way more heat than it’s getting.</p><p>There are more things happening in&nbsp;its atmosphere, especially if&nbsp;you compare it&nbsp;to&nbsp;its neighbor Uranus. Uranus is&nbsp;closer to&nbsp;the Sun, but it&nbsp;still radiates the same amount of&nbsp;heat as&nbsp;Neptune. The winds on&nbsp;Neptune are insanely strong&nbsp;— 1,500 miles per hour. No&nbsp;one still knows why. It&nbsp;could be&nbsp;a&nbsp;gravitational contraction, energy coming from its core, or&nbsp;the Sun&nbsp;— I&nbsp;hope we’ll eventually find out.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/89b/61d/a687ac51d2852cc767ed2ed6a6.png><p>Can you imagine hot ice? It&nbsp;exists just 33&nbsp;light-years away from&nbsp;us, on&nbsp;one exoplanet [Gliese 436&nbsp;b]. This planet consists of&nbsp;different water elements, and they form burning ice. The ice there is&nbsp;solid because of&nbsp;pressure. But the surface temperatures are extreme and go&nbsp;up&nbsp;to&nbsp;570 °F.&nbsp;That’s how the water stays super-hot and comes off as&nbsp;steam.</p><p>Picture putting ice in&nbsp;your coffee when you want to&nbsp;heat it&nbsp;up! When you stargaze, it’s almost like you’re looking into the past. Stars are really far away, and it&nbsp;takes longer for their light to&nbsp;reach our planet. So, it’s possible some of&nbsp;them have already run out of&nbsp;fuel and aren’t “alive” anymore. The Pillars of&nbsp;Creation are a&nbsp;good example. This is&nbsp;part of&nbsp;a&nbsp;region 7000 light-years away from&nbsp;us called the Eagle Nebula.</p><p>These are clouds of&nbsp;gas and dust in&nbsp;the shape of&nbsp;pillars. Scientists first discovered it&nbsp;in&nbsp;1995, but in&nbsp;reality, a&nbsp;supernova explosion destroyed these pillars that were at&nbsp;least 6,000 years ago. So, the 1995 image shows these Pillars from 7,000 years ago. Mars has the biggest volcano in&nbsp;the Solar System that we&nbsp;know of&nbsp;so&nbsp;far [Olympus Mons]. It’s bigger than the whole state of&nbsp;Hawaii and 100 times larger than the biggest volcano on&nbsp;Earth [Mauna Loa, Hawaii].</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/ceb/27f/00912f5259b10a705435e685bd.png><p>The Red planet seems so&nbsp;quiet, but once upon a&nbsp;time, large volcanoes dominated its surface. Volcanoes on&nbsp;the Red planet can probably grow so&nbsp;big because gravity there is&nbsp;a&nbsp;lot weaker than down on&nbsp;Earth.</p><p>Also, the crust on&nbsp;our planet is&nbsp;moving all the time, and the Martian crust probably stays still.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZMSpxYysp5qblWK2tHnCqKOdZZmberW0xGaqrqZdnsButM6tZHFpZGuFcXs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

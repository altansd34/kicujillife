To start with, I’m a good test-taker. I passed my Spanish Advanced Placement exam in high school on the first try. I also know <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong><span>tips and tricks</span></strong> </a>for studying based on my own experience learning multiple languages. As a former Spanish language tutor, there are study tips that I wish my own students would follow. Here is how to prepare for your Spanish exam.</p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong><span>How to have a Spanish accent</span></strong></a></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>2. <strong>Revisit Spanish vocabulary</strong></h3><p>Prepare for your Spanish exam by making sure that your vocabulary is solid. I do this in a two-part process using both visual (written) study and oral (spoken) study styles. <strong><span><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Harvard </a></span></strong>and other academic institutions support research that using multiple senses to study makes information stick in your brain.&nbsp;</p><p>First, comb through class notes and make a mini dictionary. Group your words by theme (question words, food, activities, verbs, etc.) and make a list. You can work in a handwritten notebook or a Word document. On the left side of the page write the word in Spanish. On the right side put the definition. Your first revision is done!</p><p>Second, test yourself by doing a mini quiz on each theme. Cover the definition side of the page. Say each word aloud. (Yes, I actually talk to myself when I study!) If you can’t recall the definition right away, highlight it or make a flashcard immediately. When you are done quizzing, go over the missed vocab. Remember: If you can’t get it without looking, then you don’t know it.</p><p><strong><span><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Best Spanish insults and curse words (use with caution)</a></span></strong></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>3. <strong>Prepare oral responses</strong></h3><p>Some tests have an oral response portion. If your exam doesn’t, it’s still smart to practise speaking Spanish out loud. Feel silly? Talk to a mirror, a cuddly teddy bear, or ask a classmate to quiz with you. Go over practise exam questions if you have them. Otherwise, follow my instructions for free-form oral study.&nbsp;</p><p>Make creative speeches from scratch. This free-form exercise cements <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong><span>Spanish vocabulary</span></strong> </a>in your brain by forcing context. It also exercises the creative part of your brain and takes you out of the memorisation zone. Using the themes from above, try to speak for a whole minute on each topic. Make up a story! See how many vocab words you can fit into real sentences. There are no rules except that you can’t stop talking. Done? Now do three minutes. Then do five minutes.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong><span>Why should you learn a language online during coronavirus?</span></strong></a></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>4. <strong>Practice written grammar</strong></h3><p>Spanish grammar is so specific. My best tip is to exercise your ability to contrast types of grammar using the same scenario. For example if you are studying <strong><span><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">imperfect vs. preterite in Spanish,</a></span></strong> take a simple phrase like Yo soy estudiante. (I am a student). Make contrasting sentences using the grammar: Yo era estudiante. Yo fui estudiante. Now write down in English how those phrases differ in meaning. Advanced students can explain in Spanish. This exercise works well with a study buddy.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong><span>How to write a letter in Spanish</span></strong></a></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>5. <strong>Avoid common mistakes</strong></h3><p>Common mistakes are just that: common. Everybody makes them. If you specifically train them out of your Spanish learning, you will quickly become a more fluent Spanish speaker.&nbsp;</p><p>The Lingoda language blog is a great resource to get familiar. Our language expert bloggers write about common mistakes a lot. For example, read <strong><span><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">4 common mistakes of using subjuntivo in Spanish</a></span></strong> or <strong><span><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Por vs. Para in Spanish</a></span></strong> to avoid pitfalls. The Lingoda blog even has a search bar so you can filter by topic.</p><p><strong><span><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">All about Spanish accent marks and word stress</a></span></strong></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>6. <strong>Prepare mentally</strong></h3><p>Finally, you should be mentally fit for your exam. That means no all-nighters. Exercise and eat a balanced meal (or scarf hot cheetos like I do). Go to bed on time the night before. At the beginning of this post I asked you to envision the night before your exam. If you try your best to avoid procrastination, you will have peace of mind when you wake up on the morning of your test. ¡Mucha suerte!

It was a difficult adjustment period for his brother Max and him but joining the soccer team led them to make friends. Louis and Max lost one of their best friends, Russell to suicide. They were such close friends that Louis even referred to Russell as a part of the family.</p><p>Russell was a huge supporter of Louis and his music and would film videos of him singing and playing the piano. Louis knew that Russell was going through a hard time but did not know the extent of it. A year and a half before Louis auditioned for American Idol, Russell took his own life. He broke down in tears talking about this difficult time prior to his audition. “When something like that happens, it stops your whole world,” he said.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">STREET SINGER ON ‘AMERICAN IDOL’ MAKES JENNIFER LOPEZ CRY WITH ORIGINAL SONG [VIDEO]</a></strong></p><p>“I think you might be the biggest star we’ve ever had on American Idol” Luke Bryan said after hearing Louis sing.

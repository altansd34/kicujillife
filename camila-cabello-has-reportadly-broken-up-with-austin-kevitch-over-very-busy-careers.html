The former Fifth Harmony singer and the CEO of the Lox Club had been linked together since last summer, but now it appears that the couple has officially broken up.</p><p>A newsletter sent to subscribers of the dating app announced the news that Kevitch is single once again. The former couple has yet to address the news at the moment but a source close to them has confirmed the public about their breakup.</p><p>“Camila and Austin broke up, there’s no bad blood between them and they’re both just very busy in their careers,” The source said.</p><p>It’s never easy when two people decide to go their separate ways and these two were no different. Fans of both Cabello and Kevitch were shocked to learn that they had split. Despite the breakup, it appears that both <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Cabello</a> and Kevitch are on good terms.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>They Allegedly Dated For Eight Months</h2><p>Cabello and Kevitch first sparked <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">romance rumors</a> in June of 2022, after they were spotted spending time together in Los Angeles. After two months, the pair were spotted walking hand in hand together after grabbing some drinks at a local cafe. In November of last year, they were spotted having dinner together in Santa Monica.</p><p>We’re not sure how this couple came to be, since Cabello is pretty open about disliking dating apps. On the other hand, Kevitch is very pro-dating apps. His app, The Lox Club, has a vast pool of single women, so it’s possible that he looks for love on there. In October 2022, Cabello told Drew Barrymore that she deleted an app after only 24 hours.</p><p>“I was on a dating app for like 24 hours, then I left,” Cabello said. “The first guy that DM’d me was an aspiring singer-songwriter from Nashville. I was just like, I feel weird because somebody could be using me, I mean you don’t know their intentions.”</p><p>Cabello was formerly in a relationship with fellow singer <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Shawn Mendes</a>. After two and a half years together, they announced their separation in November 2021.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Original_AngelinaJordan_CharacterMediaGala-220x147.jpg alt="‘Got Talent’ Star Angelina Jordan Sings Powerhouse Covers in New Performance" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57wpqkoqSRYrCirsSlo6hlmJbAbr7EqaarrJGZubp5waumpJ2eYsKxedaiq6FlkarAtbXNZqKerpmpsKl5zq%2Bcq2Wmmr%2B6ecGuqrJlk5a%2FprHRrGY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

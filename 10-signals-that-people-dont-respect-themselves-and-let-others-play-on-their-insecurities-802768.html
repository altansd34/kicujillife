And we&nbsp;often have to&nbsp;make compromises, while trying to&nbsp;be&nbsp;kind and polite. But very often, being good actually backfires because some people see it&nbsp;as&nbsp;a&nbsp;weakness and try to&nbsp;use&nbsp;us for their own purposes. There’s a&nbsp;fine line between being polite and not respecting yourself and we&nbsp;all need to&nbsp;be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;not cross&nbsp;it.</p><p>We&nbsp;at&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side</strong> have discussed this problem many times and we&nbsp;finally want to&nbsp;show you what happens to&nbsp;people that don’t believe in&nbsp;themselves.</p><p><h2>They skimp on&nbsp;themselves to&nbsp;buy something for someone else.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b61/4b1/f7377b565aa72962a4b0373378.jpg><p>We&nbsp;often think that when we&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>don’t buy</a> something we&nbsp;want, we&nbsp;can prove something to&nbsp;other people. For example, we&nbsp;think a&nbsp;husband will love it&nbsp;if&nbsp;his wife doesn’t buy something she wants or&nbsp;needs to&nbsp;make room for his needs. But in&nbsp;fact, people just end up&nbsp;thinking that this is&nbsp;exactly how it&nbsp;should&nbsp;be. And if&nbsp;we&nbsp;can’t spend money or&nbsp;time on&nbsp;ourselves, other people will think we&nbsp;don’t deserve&nbsp;it.</p><p><h2>They don’t love their bodies.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/740/4bd/dd5cd450e3be8c7ee36647ac81.jpg><p>In&nbsp;the modern world, it&nbsp;may be&nbsp;hard to&nbsp;love your imperfect body: all the magazine covers and web pages we&nbsp;are exposed to&nbsp;have photos of&nbsp;perfect models without wrinkles and extra weight. So, of&nbsp;course, many women have <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>an&nbsp;inferiority complex</a> because of&nbsp;that. But beauty is&nbsp;very subjective. Some people will think that you look like a&nbsp;goddess, some people won’t. So, in&nbsp;the end, it&nbsp;doesn’t matter if&nbsp;you have wrinkles, you will find someone who loves you for what you are.</p><p><h2>They don’t express their opinions.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/61a/92a/eaeeaf5cc784b18a3d8373dd5a.jpg><p>Sometimes, we&nbsp;do&nbsp;things just because we&nbsp;don’t know how to&nbsp;say&nbsp;no. We&nbsp;drive an&nbsp;extra mile, we&nbsp;waste our time and our gas, we&nbsp;arrive late to&nbsp;work&nbsp;— all to&nbsp;not have to&nbsp;say the terrible word “no.” Either we&nbsp;are <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>scared</a> of&nbsp;offending other people or&nbsp;we&nbsp;don’t want to&nbsp;look rude or&nbsp;selfish. And there are many people that use our weaknesses against&nbsp;us.</p><p><h2>They don’t trust themselves and ask for advice all the time.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ba5/213/984f94539c8664b0d548155d6c.jpg><p>Insecurity can <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>sometimes</a> be&nbsp;useful&nbsp;— it&nbsp;keeps&nbsp;us safe from unnecessary risks and dangerous consequences. But being too self-critical and unsatisfied with yourself can <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>lead</a> to&nbsp;depression. People that don’t believe in&nbsp;themselves and look around for advice often become the victims of&nbsp;someone else’s manipulations. It&nbsp;just makes them feel more uncomfortable.</p><p><h2>They try not to&nbsp;say&nbsp;no.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b0c/f60/3cb4b250efbfbf0646ccf258a8.jpg><p>Many people are <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>unable</a> to&nbsp;say no&nbsp;because they want other people’s approval. The reason is&nbsp;that they didn’t get enough love from their parents. They had to&nbsp;work hard to&nbsp;deserve&nbsp;it. So, when you know that love has to&nbsp;be&nbsp;earned, you try to&nbsp;be&nbsp;good for everyone when you are an&nbsp;adult. This is&nbsp;really convenient for other people but really hard for the people pleaser.</p><p><h2>They tolerate obvious disrespect.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/848/51e/06802553cba9bf92eb2a4a9ee0.jpg><p>Many of&nbsp;us have had to&nbsp;deal with disrespect, but we&nbsp;all react in&nbsp;different ways. People with the so-called <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>victim-mentality</a> are ready to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>tolerate</a> a&nbsp;lot and other people just say something like, “I&nbsp;guess, he&nbsp;enjoys&nbsp;it.” But, in&nbsp;reality, these people just don’t have the power to&nbsp;find a&nbsp;way out of&nbsp;an&nbsp;abusive relationship. Unfortunately, there is&nbsp;always someone that will use this person.</p><p><h2>They can’t recognize abject flattery.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/68c/592/9c363457a99463109361e7863c.jpg><p>When people lack self-confidence, they don’t get enough respect and attention and they have the <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>need</a> to&nbsp;feel that they matter. These people are easily flattered. But of&nbsp;course, this might come at&nbsp;a&nbsp;high price. Many people will use this to&nbsp;their own advantage. So, people that flatter their bosses often have better positions and work conditions.</p><p><h2>They do&nbsp;things against their own interest.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/dfe/c72/6b79395211b6fda4d2ce14281c.jpg><p>We&nbsp;often want to&nbsp;do&nbsp;anything to&nbsp;satisfy our friends’ and relatives’ needs, even if&nbsp;it&nbsp;harms our own interests. But in&nbsp;fact, the sacrifices we&nbsp;make are not as&nbsp;necessary as&nbsp;they might seem. More than that, in&nbsp;some cases, it&nbsp;is&nbsp;bad to&nbsp;act this way. For example, when we&nbsp;do&nbsp;it&nbsp;in&nbsp;front of&nbsp;our <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>children</a>, we&nbsp;show them that they don’t need to&nbsp;accept their responsibilities.</p><p><h2>They tolerate it&nbsp;when other people don’t take their jobs seriously.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b9f/06c/525b4a501e8503df47c6e2ecd6.jpg><p>A&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;people still think that those who are <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>freelancers</a> don’t really work, they just get paid. It’s because nobody actually sees you working: you don’t go&nbsp;to&nbsp;the office every day, nobody sees how tired you are. And you still get paid. This is&nbsp;why people often want to&nbsp;make you do&nbsp;more things around the house because you are at&nbsp;home anyway. And they don’t care that you have a&nbsp;real job that needs to&nbsp;be&nbsp;done.</p><p><h2>They don’t make time to&nbsp;rest.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d40/2af/3c37ae59fbb2964250ccaeddc5.jpg><p>There’s so&nbsp;much to&nbsp;do&nbsp;and so&nbsp;little time to&nbsp;do&nbsp;it. All adults have probably experienced this. But some people learn to&nbsp;ask for <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>help</a> and others keep trying to&nbsp;do&nbsp;it&nbsp;all by&nbsp;themselves. As&nbsp;a&nbsp;result, the workload never gets better and we&nbsp;get so&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>exhausted</a> that we&nbsp;can’t even enjoy our lives anymore.</p><p>Have you ever had similar situations in&nbsp;your life?

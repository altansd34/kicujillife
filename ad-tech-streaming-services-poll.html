Streaming services and ad tech companies on their own can’t do the same, he said, because they don’t own the hardware.
“What we tell advertisers is that we believe it’s the wisest approach to go direct to device,” Hockersmith said."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

This, however, is not yet the norm in the industry.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">“The problem is that for many marketers, they just don’t have multiple versions,” he said. “A lot more marketers are now understanding that you can do things like that.”</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">But there are other issues. Bryon Schafer, senior vice president of research at music video streaming service Vevo, said the problem is also tied to outdated ideology around CPMs — or cost per thousand impressions, the industry’s most important metric.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">For many ad buyers, it’s “more palatable” to hit viewership goals by purchasing many ad placements at low CPMs, even if that means they’re ultimately reaching fewer people on fewer platforms, he said.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">“The CPM is misleading,” Schafer said. The common thinking is that low CPMs are always better, “but that means more frequency and not the unique reach that you get with a more diversified media plan.”</p><h2 class="font-semibold text-headline2 leading-headline2 mb-m">Improvement by innovation: Streaming services introduce more interactive ad formats</h2><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Streaming services already offer a lighter ad load than linear TV — four to eight minutes per hour, compared to 17 on traditional television. Still, 44 percent of consumers said there are too many ads on streaming services in the September poll. Companies can’t advertise much less than they already are without losing money, but there are ways to make ads seem more palatable without reducing them in frequency.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">To bother viewers less, streaming services are starting to move away from the traditional block of commercials and experiment with ad breaks, interactive ad formats and other new models enabled by the internet.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">HBO Max, for example, introduced brand blocks, or blocks of content sponsored by a marketer that result in a reduced commercial experience for the viewer. Other services, including Peacock, have tried “binge ads,” which reward audiences with a commercial-free episode, brought to them by a brand.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiooqR7rrvRp6Cnn5Oku7TBy61lnKedZLavv9Oapa1lmaPBpriOmptmrJWYtW6%2F06ucmqWZo7Ruv8SrraKblah6sbvLpQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

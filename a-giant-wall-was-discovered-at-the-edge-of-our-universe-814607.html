Whoa, looks like this multicolored nebula will soon collapse under its own weight and explode like a&nbsp;supernova. Now let’s carefully circle this <a href=# title="black hole" data-link=tag>black hole</a>.</p><p>Try not to&nbsp;get caught in&nbsp;its gravitational field, or&nbsp;it’ll swallow you like a&nbsp;space monster. Hmmm, wait. What is&nbsp;that strange structure right there? It’s a&nbsp;glowing wall!</p><p>And if&nbsp;you look closely, each glowing dot is&nbsp;an&nbsp;entire galaxy. That wall has about 100,000 of&nbsp;these galaxies. The Milky Way has <strong>100 billion</strong> stars. So&nbsp;this wall holds a&nbsp;quadrillion (that’s 10&nbsp;followed by&nbsp;15&nbsp;zeros) of&nbsp;stars like our Sun.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/f47/a3e/e1862d57c2997a079b9da5512f.png><p>This giant structure is&nbsp;called the South Pole Wall. It’s located about 500 million light-years from Earth. By&nbsp;comparison, the closest star to&nbsp;our home is&nbsp;Proxima Centauri, and it’s about 4.2 light-years away. Rockets can cover that distance in&nbsp;about 73,000&nbsp;years. So&nbsp;the journey to&nbsp;the South Pole Wall may take longer than our <a href=# title="solar system" data-link=tag>solar system</a> exists. And this wall is&nbsp;simply gigantic, even on&nbsp;a&nbsp;cosmic scale. It’s about 1.37 billion light-years long.</p><p>To&nbsp;give you an&nbsp;idea of&nbsp;how large that&nbsp;is, the Milky Way is&nbsp;only 100,000 light-years wide. But you can’t see this wall even with the most powerful telescope. The problem is&nbsp;that the Milky Way itself obstructs your view. It’s so&nbsp;bright that it’s hiding this wall. It’s like trying to&nbsp;look at&nbsp;the starry sky in&nbsp;a&nbsp;metropolis. The light pollution won’t let you do&nbsp;that.</p><p>Scientists have been able to&nbsp;detect this galactic wall by&nbsp;measuring redshift. We&nbsp;know that all objects in&nbsp;the universe are moving. They spread out from each other as&nbsp;a&nbsp;result of&nbsp;the Big Bang, which happened billions of&nbsp;years ago. And when galaxies move, their light waves change slightly. By&nbsp;measuring this change, we&nbsp;can understand what the object&nbsp;is, and how it&nbsp;moves. And this wall isn’t even the largest in&nbsp;our universe. This is&nbsp;the Hercules-Corona Borealis Great Wall.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/1f3/6ea/e86e265f08af54f4fed44e4cf5.png><p>It’s a&nbsp;giant flat superstructure about 10&nbsp;billion light-years wide. That’s around&nbsp;10% of&nbsp;the entire observable universe. And it’s also a&nbsp;wall. That is&nbsp;a&nbsp;cluster of&nbsp;galaxies. We&nbsp;were able to&nbsp;detect this giant structure by&nbsp;gamma-ray bursts. It’s the brightest electromagnetic event in&nbsp;the universe. You could even see it&nbsp;in&nbsp;the far reaches of&nbsp;our universe.</p><p>Such bursts are a&nbsp;very rare event. In&nbsp;the Milky Way, for example, it&nbsp;happens once every few million years. If&nbsp;we&nbsp;notice many such bursts in&nbsp;a&nbsp;short time from the same place, it&nbsp;means that there are many objects like the Milky Way in&nbsp;that place. So, there are a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;galaxies out there. Another unusual giant structure in&nbsp;the universe is&nbsp;the Huge Large Quasar Group. It’s about 4&nbsp;billion light-years across.</p><p>So&nbsp;it&nbsp;takes a&nbsp;photon of&nbsp;light almost as&nbsp;long as&nbsp;our planet has existed just to&nbsp;get from one side of&nbsp;the structure to&nbsp;the other. And if&nbsp;you put the Huge Large Quasar Group on&nbsp;the scale, it&nbsp;would be&nbsp;6.1 billion times heavier than our Sun. Scientists have found that there are at&nbsp;least 73&nbsp;quasars in&nbsp;that structure. These are some of&nbsp;the most unusual objects in&nbsp;the universe. They are the active cores of&nbsp;galaxies. At&nbsp;the center of&nbsp;a&nbsp;quasar is&nbsp;a&nbsp;supermassive black hole. This giant eats up&nbsp;the matter around&nbsp;it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/9fe/b96/e7021459daa282221bf002f090.png><p>A&nbsp;wild force of&nbsp;gravity twists the matter around the black hole, forming a&nbsp;disk. And this disk is&nbsp;the source of&nbsp;the strongest radiation out there. By&nbsp;comparison, the radiation from a&nbsp;single quasar is&nbsp;tens or&nbsp;hundreds of&nbsp;times stronger than that of&nbsp;all the stars in&nbsp;our galaxy put together. Because of&nbsp;such strong radiation, we&nbsp;can detect quasars even at&nbsp;very long distances.</p><p>That’s why they’re also called beacons of&nbsp;the universe. Scientists use quasars to&nbsp;study the universe and the movement within&nbsp;it. One of&nbsp;the most distant quasars from&nbsp;us [ULAS J1342+0928] is&nbsp;about 13.1 billion light-years away. This makes it&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the oldest objects in&nbsp;the universe. It&nbsp;appeared about 690 million years after the Big Bang, and it’s almost 3&nbsp;times older than our solar system.</p><p>It’s still glowing with extreme brightness, about 4&nbsp;and 14&nbsp;zeroes times brighter than the Sun. Scientists explain that at&nbsp;the center of&nbsp;the giant is&nbsp;a&nbsp;supermassive black hole, 800 million times heavier than the Sun. All these giant structures are just building blocks of&nbsp;our universe. Look, this is&nbsp;our Solar system. Now, zoom out a&nbsp;little. This is&nbsp;where our home star is&nbsp;in&nbsp;the Milky Way galaxy. Zoom out, again. Here’s a&nbsp;local group of&nbsp;galaxies.</p><p>All the bright spots here are galaxies. Here’s Andromeda. And here’s the Triangulum galaxy. Plus, a&nbsp;few dozen other, slightly smaller galaxies. They’re all gravitationally connected. The size of&nbsp;this structure is&nbsp;about 10&nbsp;million light-years. That’s 100 times the width of&nbsp;our galaxy. Zoom out, please. This one is&nbsp;the Virgo supercluster. It’s 20&nbsp;times larger than the local group. There are about 30,000 different galaxies. And the mass of&nbsp;the whole thing is&nbsp;about 1&nbsp;and 15&nbsp;zeroes solar masses.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/f8d/495/46e4a25782b4001f176b407a47.png><p>Zoom out again! Laniakea. This structure is&nbsp;almost 3&nbsp;times larger. It&nbsp;includes the Virgo supercluster and other smaller clusters. And there are about 100,000 galaxies here. It’s not over yet. Zoom out one more time. Here’s the Pisces-Cetus supercluster complex.</p><p>This giant galactic structure contains about 60&nbsp;clusters of&nbsp;galaxies. So&nbsp;there are more galaxies in&nbsp;it&nbsp;than grains of&nbsp;sand in&nbsp;the desert. You know what to&nbsp;do&nbsp;— zoom out! Phew, this is&nbsp;the observable universe. There are over 500 billion galaxies. And the stars... Well, there are about 1&nbsp;billion trillion stars.</p><p>The observable universe has its own structure. Clusters of&nbsp;galaxies form chains and walls, as&nbsp;you’ve seen before. But these strands are separated by&nbsp;huge regions of&nbsp;absolute emptiness. These areas are called voids. In&nbsp;these places, there is&nbsp;no&nbsp;matter at&nbsp;all. There are fewer molecules in&nbsp;the voids than in&nbsp;an&nbsp;empty room. One of&nbsp;these voids has a&nbsp;very mystical reputation.</p><p>It’s the Eridanus [ih-ri-da-nus] Supervoid or&nbsp;the Cold Spot. It&nbsp;appeared here only 380,000 years after the Big Bang. It’s almost 1&nbsp;billion light-years wide and could hold hundreds or&nbsp;thousands of&nbsp;galaxies with trillions of&nbsp;stars. Some scientists believe that this Cold Spot may have been the result of&nbsp;the largest collision ever. A&nbsp;collision of&nbsp;universes. There’s a&nbsp;theory that our universe is&nbsp;some kind of&nbsp;bubble. A&nbsp;huge sphere that contains all these walls and chains of&nbsp;galaxies.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/985/129/4e576f5bbc8197773082146ab8.png><p>Now imagine that there’s an&nbsp;infinite number of&nbsp;these bubbles. They could be&nbsp;parallel worlds or&nbsp;different universes. Many years ago, one bubble came close to&nbsp;the bubble of&nbsp;our universe. Their walls touched, and the two universes connected for a&nbsp;while. It’s like two drops of&nbsp;water coming together. But that universe kept moving.</p><p>The area where the bubbles joined became thinner and thinner until that connection broke, and the two bubbles detached from each other. At&nbsp;this point, the second universe ripped some of&nbsp;the material out of&nbsp;our bubble. All those galaxies that used to&nbsp;fill the Eridanus Supervoid ended up&nbsp;in&nbsp;a&nbsp;parallel universe. Scientists supposed we&nbsp;might travel through other bubbles. Flying to&nbsp;the supposed wall of&nbsp;our universe would take forever. And then it&nbsp;would take even longer to&nbsp;fly through interuniversal space.</p><p>So&nbsp;we&nbsp;have to&nbsp;use portals or&nbsp;wormholes. Here’s how it&nbsp;works. Imagine a&nbsp;piece of&nbsp;paper with point&nbsp;A on&nbsp;one side and point&nbsp;B on&nbsp;the other. Instead of&nbsp;moving all the way across the sheet of&nbsp;paper, we&nbsp;just fold the sheet, so&nbsp;that point&nbsp;A is&nbsp;right above point B.&nbsp;All that’s left to&nbsp;do&nbsp;is&nbsp;make a&nbsp;small hole, and the journey takes only moments.</p><p>Some scientists believe that such shortcuts through universes lie inside black holes. But how do&nbsp;you survive falling into a&nbsp;black hole? You just have to&nbsp;pick one that’s big enough. It’s all about gravity. Imagine you’re falling into a&nbsp;black hole right now. The closer you get to&nbsp;it, the stronger effect it&nbsp;has on&nbsp;you. It&nbsp;intensifies with every inch.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/e68/f1c/73626f59dbb4fa3b265e507f3d.png><p>At&nbsp;one point, the gravitational force that affects your head is&nbsp;much stronger than the one that affects your feet. Then you turn into spaghetti. Yum! But if&nbsp;you choose a&nbsp;supermassive black hole like the ones at&nbsp;the centers of&nbsp;galaxies, the gravitational force in&nbsp;them increases gradually.</p><p>They can be&nbsp;millions of&nbsp;times heavier than the Sun and much bigger. But the gravitational force on&nbsp;your head and your feet will be&nbsp;almost equal, and you will still feel comfortable. Who knows, maybe if&nbsp;you manage to&nbsp;survive a&nbsp;fall into such a&nbsp;massive black hole, you will find yourself in&nbsp;a&nbsp;completely different universe, where different laws of&nbsp;physics apply. But so&nbsp;far, this is&nbsp;just a&nbsp;theory.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZK5us8iapa1lp5a5rXnWmqpmnJmosLDCxKucnWWRqXq1tMRmnJ2flWK8p3nOrqlmrZ6ew6a%2B0p5kcWlka314ew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

Unfortunately for Holly, the judges on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The X Factor UK</a> didn’t think that she was as talented a singer as she believes. Holly, who works as a holiday camp singer, did not impress the judges from the start of the audition. After the awful performance, the judges told her that she is not a good singer and Louis Walsh even told her she has a career in sales instead. Yikes! </strong><strong>Watch the audition below</strong><span>.</span></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p><span>Simon Cowell Pokes Fun at Holly’s Mouth</span></p><p><span>Usually, during a singing audition, contestants spend time performing and showing off their voice, but Holly instead went on a rant about why she deserves to be there.</span></p><p><span>“I’ve trained for four years! I’ve gone out there and I’ve learned performance doing jobs I don’t want to do. But it means I get to wake up every morning and say I do what I love for a living. I’m getting paid to do it. Look at me here’s my stage. I’m Holly Jervis and you have not heard anything like me,” she said.</span></p><p><span>Cowell was starting to get bored of her and many times the camera panned to him waiting for Holly to stop talking and get singing. Even Louis Walsh had to interrupt her and tell her to start singing.</span></p><p><span>She finally begins to perform with the song “Big Blonde and Beautiful” from the famous Broadway show </span>Hairspray. <span>Throughout the performance, all <a href=# class=broken_link>the judges</a> are confused and not amused by her voice.</span> Walsh<span> even starts laughing at the end.</span></p><p><span>Simon on the other hand goes on to insult Holly’s mouth telling her, “Your mouth is far too big when you sing, it was like looking into a cave, I’ve never seen anything so big in my life. And because your mouth is so big this weird noise comes out of it. It was absolutely terrible.”</span></p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# class=broken_link>HOW SIMON COWELL IS HELPING FORMER ‘X FACTOR’ JUDGE CHERYL WITH HER CAREER.</a></strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-x-factor-judges-career-suggestions-for-holly>The X Factor Judges’ Career Suggestions for Holly</h3><p><span>Holly doesn’t</span> take<span> the judge’s criticism very lightly, she starts bringing up the fact that she’s employed as a singer by a holiday firm.</span></p><p><span>“I’ve sung over the years to thousands of people. So why would I keep getting employed if I’m as bad as you say please? answer me that,” Holly continues to interrupt Cowell while he tries to give her advice on her voice and that there is a difference between being a singer and being a recording artist.</span></p><p>Due to Holly’s constant interruptions and long rants, the judges suggest she looks into speech, sales, and motivational speaking. Even though that’s not what the 23-year-old would like to hear from the judges she is able to take their criticism lightly. Unlike many, who have reacted to criticism badly.</p><p>She thanks them and leaves the stage politely. Holly didn’t stop boasting about her professional career though.</p><p>“To hear I’m in the wrong profession, thousands of people around this country can’t be wrong. My agent can’t be wrong, and I’m not wrong,” she tells the camera.<span></span></p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# class=broken_link>WATCH BEATBOXER WITH STUTTER MAKE MUSIC USING ONLY HIS MOUTH ON ‘ITALIA’S GOT TALENT’</a></strong></p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Arthur-Gunn-American-Idol-The-Comeback-Disney-Night-Alyssa-Wray-eliminated-scaled-2.jpeg alt="‘American Idol’ Fans Outraged After Arthur Gunn Returns to the Competition" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>the x-factor UK</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK571pqrnKBdrXqnrcKtpqtlpaB6q8HDoJysZZWir6K%2B0ZqqrKGenHqkrdGenKtlo6q0qLHSraCopqNis7C%2BjKygp5%2BVp7WwuMuyZKOdoqu2tHs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

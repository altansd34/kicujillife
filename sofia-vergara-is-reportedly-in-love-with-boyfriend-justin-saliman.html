According to a new report, Vergara is “in love” with Saliman and could get engaged soon.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-sofia-vergara-reportedly-in-love-with-justin-saliman>Sofia Vergara Reportedly ‘In Love’ with Justin Saliman</h2><p>Vergara <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">split from her ex-husband</a> Joe Manganiello last year after seven years of marriage. A few months later, the actress was spotted on a date with Saliman in Los Angeles. In November, a source said that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Vergara was “extra happy”</a> in the new relationship.</p><p>The Modern Family star went Instagram official with Saliman in April of this year, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">posting a photo of him</a> on her stories. As she recovered from knee surgery, she wrote that anyone undergoing a similar procedure should “get a handsome doctor who will sleep with u that night.”</p><p>“Her intention going into this with Justin [Saliman] was that it was simply going to be a bit of fun to get her over Joe. It’s turned into way more than that,” a source recently told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Life & Style</a>. “Sofia is a romantic at heart and still believes in marriage and she’s in love. The way she’s talking they could easily be engaged by the end of this year.”</p><p class=has-text-align-left><strong>SEE ALSO:</strong> <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">SOFIA VERGARA POSTS NUDE PHOTO TO TEASE NEW LINE OF COFFEE</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-why-did-vergara-s-marriage-end>Why Did Vergara’s Marriage End?</h2><p>There have been conflicting reports about exactly why Vergara and Manganiello decided to divorce. In <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">an interview</a> earlier this year, Vergara claimed that they split because Manganiello wanted to have children, and she didn’t want to be an “old mom.”</p><p>However, in <a href=#>an interview last month</a>, Manganiello denied that this was the reason they parted ways. He shared that he and Vergara “did try to have a family for the first year and a half.” Although he did want to have kids, he said that “wasn’t inevitably why everything ended.”</p><p>“To be painted as if I had some sort of midlife crisis, and after nine years, turned to somebody and gave them an ultimatum of, ‘Do this potentially unhealthy thing to your body, or else I’m gone’? That’s never who I was,” Manganiello told Men’s Journal.</p><p>So why did they decide to divorce? “It’s because two people grew apart, and sometimes that happens,” said Manganiello, who has since started dating actress Caitlin O’Connor.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Original_SnoopDogg2_Jerod-HarrisGetty-Images-220x147.jpeg alt="Snoop Dogg Rumored to Make $500K Per Day at the Paris Olympics" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>sofia vergara</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK570qidopldq7Kzs8CrmGaho2K%2FprzOq6uenJyueqq6jKWmr51drLa1tIybprKeop6yr7CMo6ysrJmjerSty6KkmqZf</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

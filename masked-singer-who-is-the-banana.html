And the Banana proves just that! His stage presence is one of the most a-peel-ing all season! But who’s under the mask?</strong></p><p>Here are the clues and predictions for the Banana so far!</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nAHsQ-kLM</p>Banana performing “Achy Breaky Heart” by Billy Ray Cyrus on The Masked Singer Group B Playoffs</figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Clues On&nbsp;‘The Masked Singer’ Season 3</h3><p>In The Masked Singer Banana’s <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="first set of clues (opens in a new tab)" href=#>first set of clues</a>, he is seen sleeping on a blanket next to a cowboy hat and a blowfish. He gets a text asking “Banana! Where R U?” Then one of the men in black slips on a banana peel. Banana has a Southern accent and recounts last night. He says, “you would think this is my first rodeo.” He’s “tough on the outside but a total smoothie on the inside and a total hoot to have at parties.” Banana is shown blurred out looking for his clothes, then we see a blue-collar.</p><p>During the second <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>clues package</a>, the Banana starts in what looks like a scene from “The Office.” 2:13 is shown on an alarm clock with the date 6/8 and an alarm set for 9:15. He exclaims, “Get ‘er done!” Then, he moves to a room where there are “Sons of Bananarchy” and “Banana ‘Chips’” posters behind them. One of the men in black is seen wearing cowboy boots. Banana explains he was in talks about his image and he had to say, “Spit it out! You don’t gotta hold my hand.” They are concerned about his shelf life and say he needs a re-brand, showing a computer screen with a snake on it. Banana says he’s “high in carbs” and has a “few bruises,” but he’s still here “after all these years.”</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Fan Theories for The Banana on ‘The Masked Singer’</h3><p>Most of the guesses for the Banana have centered around comedians or actors. Ken guessed Larry the Cable Guy, Nicole predicted it’s Ed Helms from The Hangover, Jenny thought it might be Bill Engvall, and guest panelists have predicted Darius Rucker and Billy Bob Thornton. Online, people have been agreeing with guesses that it’s Jeff Foxworthy, Bill Engvall, or Poison’s Bret Michaels.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO:</strong> <a href=#><strong>OUR RECAP OF THE MASKED SINGER GROUP B KICKOFF + THE FROG REVEALED</strong></a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Our Prediction For The Banana on ‘The Masked Singer’</h2><p>This is another celebrity that panelists were instantly drawn to. And if you know her voice, you know The Masked Singer Banana is…<strong>Bret Michaels</strong>!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/close-icon.png><p>First of all, his moves, mannerisms, and voice are spot on. Banana is a perfect match for Bret Michaels! But let’s go through the clues that back up our prediction.</p><p>The cowboy hat seen in all the clues so far are a nod to Bret Michaels being known for wearing one. There are also a few clues that point to his band, Poison: a blowfish and a snake, which are both poisonous animals. Banana is on a bus for his first clues, which references his reality show Rock of Love Bus. Bret Michaels is also known for his partying antics, which explain many of the clues about his partying and needing a re-brand. The blue-collar, while leading the panelists to think it was a Blue Collar Comedy Tour clue, is actually a nod to Bret’s line of pet clothing and accessories called Pets Rock.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>RELATED:</strong> <strong><a href=#>READ OUR FULL RECAP OF THE MASKED SINGER GROUP B KICKOFF</a></strong></p><p>All the boardroom clues from the second package could be alluding to his time on The Celebrity Apprentice (which he won). The TV show posters also seem refer to cable TV shows, much like Rock of Love. One of the men in black, seen in black cowboy boots, is another hint toward Bret Michael’s attire choices. Banana mentioning he’s “high in carbs” and has a “few bruises” can also be talking about the fact that he is diabetic and has had health scares in the past.</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading>More Clues Next Week</h4><p>Did we miss any clues for The Masked Singer Banana?

They tied the knot in Montana six months after their engagement. From that point on, they embarked on a nine-year IVF journey in their quest to conceive.</p><p>In a heartfelt essay published on Facebook’s Bulletin, Andrews shared her experience with fertility treatments. She revealed that she had been undergoing these treatments since she was 35 years old, acknowledging that they were both time-consuming and emotionally draining.</p><p>Andrews, now 45 years old, opened up about the difficulties she faced during this process. She expressed her gratitude for the support of her husband and shared that the journey had been one of the most challenging aspects of their lives. Despite the hardships, Andrews mentioned that she was “doing okay,” and the couple was “doing well.”</p><p>The physical toll of the ongoing fertility treatments also affected the former <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">DWTS</a> host. In an interview with Shape magazine, she revealed that she noticed changes in the health and thickness of her hair after multiple rounds of IVF. She decided to give her hair a break and removed the extensions she had been using.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>It Took a Decade For Andrews To Finally Conceive Due To Challenges</h2><p>Andrews has been transparent about her <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">health struggles</a> in the past. She had previously battled cervical cancer and had frozen embryos years before her diagnosis, never anticipating that she would need to use them. She emphasized the importance of discussing these issues openly and reducing the stigma associated with them.</p><p>The recent arrival of their baby boy brings joy and fulfillment to Andrews and Stoll. They have named their newborn son Mack and celebrated with a baby shower in June at Harriet’s in West Hollywood, California.</p><p>This news marks a significant milestone for Andrews and Stoll, who have persevered through a decade of fertility challenges. Their story serves as an inspiration to others facing similar struggles, urging them to seek support and engage in open discussions about infertility.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Zayn-Malik-Grammys.jpg alt="Zayn Malik Reveals the ‘Selfish’ Reason He Left One Direction" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57xaippp2iYrG4wNJmn6irpGKys7XNZpinnKKaxLR51p6jnKedmsButMSrZJ%2BhoqjBbq%2FHoqOdZaSkerW0xGauqKqcmXqqwNJmpaisXZqutMWO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

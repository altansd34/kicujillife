Joining the stage with her puppet Petunia, she was naturally funny and was also able to make her puppet sing “Summertime.” Darci’s performance received a standing ovation, which made her emotional and teary-eyed. Darci has so much talent that she was eventually the winner of Season 12.&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>SEE ALSO: </strong><a href=#><strong>WHO IS YOUR FAVORITE TO WIN ‘AGT: THE CHAMPIONS’ 2020?</strong></a></p><p>loading="lazy"</p><h2>Darcis Lynne and Oscar on ‘The Champions’</h2><p>“I would really like to keep ventriloquism alive because it’s not common, you know?” Darci told the judges before her performance.</p><p>She returned to&nbsp;AGT in 2019 for AGT: The Champions&nbsp;to compete against fellow past stars. She was welcomed back with open arms and Mel B tells her that she is a champion. When asked why she decided to return she said, “Well I always love a good competition, but I missed being on ‘AGT’, and maybe just having the chance to have the world champion title just seems awesome.”</p><p>Darci auditioned with her puppet, Oscar, while doing a comedic routine and performing a duet to Tina Turner’s “Rolling on the River.”</p><p>Following the performance, she received a standing ovation just like her first audition three years prior. Unfortunately, Darci Lynne didn’t win the sho. She came in second place to magician <a href=#>Shin Lim</a>, who previously won Season 13 of the show.</p><p><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel=noopener class=broken_link>SOFIA VERGARA SHOWS OFF VENTRILOQUISM SKILLS WITH DARCI LYNNE.</a></strong></p><h3>Where is Darci Now?</h3><p>loading="lazy"</p><p>Darci is currently the third ventriloquist to win America’s Got Talent, after Terry Fator and Paul Zerdin. Darci brings something new to the AGT stage being able to sing, do comedy, and of course, make puppets sing along with her.</p><p>After her win on AGT, she was given a lot of opportunities such as headlining a show in Planet Hollywood in Las Vegas. She’s also done two national tours “Darci Lynne and Friends Live” and “Fresh Out of the Box.” She also hosted Darci Lynne: My Hometown Christmas on NBC.</p><p>She continues to entertain with her puppets as well on her YouTube channel for her fans. During the pandemic, she&nbsp; posted a video in which she used <a href=#>her own dad as a ventriloquist puppet</a> making us all laugh during isolation.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/American-Idol-scaled-1.jpeg alt="‘American Idol’ Finale to Air Opposite the Billboard Music Awards" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>AGT: The champions</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>darci lyne farmer</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57w5qpnKFdocavusRmmKecXaTApK3RZqeeqpakv6550aijpaGenHqwuoytn55lop7Dpr6MraZmq6SWu6W1zaBkqK6Rqbawuo4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

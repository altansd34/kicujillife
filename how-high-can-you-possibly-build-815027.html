Ah, another one. You live on&nbsp;the 739th floor of&nbsp;X-Seed 4000. It’s an&nbsp;entire city contained in&nbsp;one massive skyscraper. It&nbsp;sounds unrealistic right now, but one day it&nbsp;may become a&nbsp;reality. Let’s see what we’d need to&nbsp;make it&nbsp;happen. But first, let’s browse through the list of&nbsp;once tallest constructions on&nbsp;the planet. The Great Pyramid of&nbsp;Giza, originally standing at&nbsp;481&nbsp;ft, used to&nbsp;be&nbsp;the tallest structure ever built by&nbsp;humans for over 3,800&nbsp;years. The Lincoln Cathedral took this title away from the Great Pyramid only in&nbsp;1311, winning by&nbsp;just one foot [482&nbsp;ft].</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/58f/213/c36409588aa69e53cb3820ae9c.png><p>Then, the Washington Monument became the new champion [555&nbsp;ft]. As&nbsp;people were starting to&nbsp;use steel more and more, the <a href=# title="Eiffel Tower" data-link=tag>Eiffel Tower</a> became the tallest construction in&nbsp;the world [1,024&nbsp;ft]. Then followed the Empire State Building [1,250&nbsp;ft]. It&nbsp;didn’t keep the title for long, with more and more skyscrapers built across the world. Let’s fast forward from here to&nbsp;the current record holder, the Burj Khalifa [2,722&nbsp;ft]. It&nbsp;has 163 floors and stands twice as&nbsp;tall as&nbsp;the Empire State Building and around 3&nbsp;times taller than the Eiffel Tower. On&nbsp;a&nbsp;clear day, you can see it&nbsp;from a&nbsp;distance of&nbsp;60&nbsp;miles. It&nbsp;takes a&nbsp;whole 1&nbsp;minute in&nbsp;a&nbsp;high-speed elevator to&nbsp;get from the ground floor to&nbsp;level 124 where one of&nbsp;the observation decks is&nbsp;located. It&nbsp;took 6&nbsp;years to&nbsp;finish this beauty which became one of&nbsp;the symbols of&nbsp;<a href=# title=Dubai data-link=tag>Dubai</a>. Speaking of&nbsp;its location, if&nbsp;you’ve ever tried building something in&nbsp;the sand, you know how hard it&nbsp;is&nbsp;to&nbsp;make the construction stable.</p><p>The engineers had to&nbsp;drill 192 holes under the 110,000-ton concrete foundation of&nbsp;this massive construction. They also brought millions of&nbsp;tons of&nbsp;sand from Australia. Yes, they brought extra sand to&nbsp;the desert because the local sand gets doughy, almost like snow, in&nbsp;endless dust storms. The Australian sand is&nbsp;less smooth and has turned into a&nbsp;perfect base for the building.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/ce1/937/8ca7725a8695c17db79b5fb391.png><p>Thanks to&nbsp;the friction between concrete and soil, these piles don’t move at&nbsp;all, and the foundation remains solid. The same architect [Adrian Smith] designed another building that is&nbsp;supposed to&nbsp;become the new record holder. The Jeddah Tower in&nbsp;Saudi Arabia is&nbsp;supposed to&nbsp;be&nbsp;almost 600 feet taller than Burj Khalifa. Once finished, the construction made of&nbsp;80,000 tons of&nbsp;steel will host the world’s highest observatory.</p><p>Jeddah Tower will have 59&nbsp;elevators, and some of&nbsp;them will be&nbsp;double-decker ones. The bottom third of&nbsp;the skyscraper is&nbsp;supposed to&nbsp;be&nbsp;office spaces, the next levels will host a&nbsp;luxury hotel, and the remaining 167 floors will be&nbsp;reserved for apartments. The narrowing silhouette of&nbsp;the building is&nbsp;supposed to&nbsp;help it&nbsp;withstand winds and gravity. The base will definitely be&nbsp;extra wide to&nbsp;make the entire construction stable. Only one-third of&nbsp;the building has been finished so&nbsp;far, and construction has been frozen for an&nbsp;unknown period of&nbsp;time. The reasons for this decision don’t have to&nbsp;do&nbsp;with geology or&nbsp;climate. Humans have learned to&nbsp;deal with all kinds of&nbsp;soils and conditions. For example, if&nbsp;we&nbsp;want to&nbsp;build our future skyscraper in&nbsp;a&nbsp;seismically active zone, we’d need to&nbsp;make it&nbsp;flexible.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/e53/176/1c335356019ab67ee7a83b9b86.png><p>Piles can hold the weight of&nbsp;the building, but the concrete pad would stand on&nbsp;huge springs. During an&nbsp;<a href=# title=earthquake data-link=tag>earthquake</a>, the ground will shake and move from side to&nbsp;side. But the springs will dampen and compensate for the movement. So&nbsp;the building will stay in&nbsp;place. The wind is&nbsp;another problem for skyscrapers. The taller the building, the more the winds affect&nbsp;it. That’s why most skyscrapers are built to&nbsp;be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;sway in&nbsp;the wind or&nbsp;have holes to&nbsp;allow the wind to&nbsp;pass through instead of&nbsp;crashing against the building’s surface. So, in&nbsp;theory, if&nbsp;you have the right materials and enough <a href=# title=funding data-link=tag>funding</a>, you can go&nbsp;as&nbsp;tall as&nbsp;you want. All you have to&nbsp;do&nbsp;is&nbsp;expand the base to&nbsp;make your construction stable. Because our planet is&nbsp;spherical in&nbsp;shape, you’d have to&nbsp;stop at&nbsp;some point, but even a&nbsp;base of&nbsp;that size would be&nbsp;enough to&nbsp;hold a&nbsp;skyscraper higher than Mount Everest itself!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/aff/5fc/7e7ff652d98f42c1c7a08b704d.png><p>X-Seed 4000 building would stop halfway in&nbsp;that race, at&nbsp;the height of&nbsp;45% of&nbsp;the world’s tallest peak [13,123&nbsp;ft]. Mt. Fuji became the inspiration for this design that might actually be&nbsp;built in&nbsp;the Tokyo harbor. It&nbsp;will be&nbsp;a&nbsp;self-contained city in&nbsp;one building, powered mostly by&nbsp;solar energy. This city can become home to&nbsp;up&nbsp;to&nbsp;one million people! And these people might not have to&nbsp;leave their huge home as&nbsp;there will also be&nbsp;offices inside. Engineers will need to&nbsp;work out several issues to&nbsp;make the whole project possible. Since the building will have 800&nbsp;floors, there will be&nbsp;a&nbsp;huge difference in&nbsp;air pressure between the top and the bottom levels. They’ll need to&nbsp;figure out a&nbsp;way to&nbsp;level it&nbsp;out so&nbsp;residents feel comfortable and healthy.</p><p>Then, just imagine the number of&nbsp;power cables to&nbsp;enable the work of&nbsp;all gadgets and mechanisms. They plan to&nbsp;replace those with renewable energy generators. The base of&nbsp;the building will have to&nbsp;be&nbsp;about 4&nbsp;miles in&nbsp;diameter to&nbsp;support its huge weight. It’s the same size as&nbsp;the bottom of&nbsp;some mighty mountain. The opening on&nbsp;the top will let some air and natural light flow inside and lighten the load on&nbsp;the foundations. X-Seed 4000 currently holds the title of&nbsp;the largest building that has ever been fully designed but is&nbsp;not on&nbsp;the list of&nbsp;building to&nbsp;be&nbsp;completed in&nbsp;the near future.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/b1a/74f/25d0275aacb5bba8746b798381.png><p>Engineers don’t rule out that with new materials and design innovations, it&nbsp;may be&nbsp;technically possible, but it&nbsp;would cost a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;money. Another ambitious project that is&nbsp;so&nbsp;far just a&nbsp;concept is&nbsp;a&nbsp;12.4-mile skyscraper. That’s 24&nbsp;Burj Khalifas put on&nbsp;top of&nbsp;each other. Science fiction author Neal Stephenson who developed the project, suggested using this skyscraper as&nbsp;a&nbsp;lift-off ground for rockets.</p><p>The author studied Physics before taking up&nbsp;science fiction, so&nbsp;the project could be&nbsp;realistic with the right high-grade steel. Stephenson claimed it&nbsp;would be&nbsp;the cheapest way to&nbsp;launch rockets into space. The engineers would also have to&nbsp;take care of&nbsp;the winds that get pretty intense at&nbsp;a&nbsp;height like this. Speaking of&nbsp;space travel, we&nbsp;might not even need rockets to&nbsp;go&nbsp;up&nbsp;there in&nbsp;the not-too-distant future. The space elevator could take humans up&nbsp;to&nbsp;an&nbsp;altitude of&nbsp;22,000 miles from the Earth’s surface. The idea is&nbsp;actually nearly 150 years old. Both NASA and researchers from different countries agree we’re now pretty close to&nbsp;its realization. Some construction companies claim they can build it&nbsp;by&nbsp;2045.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/986/f2a/acf2725a5e97eecf60e2b8f40c.png><p>The first big step towards that goal is&nbsp;to&nbsp;test how an&nbsp;elevator would act in&nbsp;space. It&nbsp;will be&nbsp;a&nbsp;unique experiment, and a&nbsp;mini elevator used in&nbsp;it&nbsp;will be&nbsp;a&nbsp;prototype of&nbsp;the future grand project. Scientists are trying to&nbsp;find the right material to&nbsp;replace the regular cable. It&nbsp;would need to&nbsp;extend for tens of&nbsp;thousands of&nbsp;miles and would be&nbsp;too heavy for the future construction. It&nbsp;looks like an&nbsp;ultra-strong material known as&nbsp;graphene could do&nbsp;the job.</p><p>Testing and building the elevator fit for space and a&nbsp;cable strong enough to&nbsp;hold it&nbsp;is&nbsp;one side of&nbsp;the story. Another problem is&nbsp;space debris&nbsp;— those pieces of&nbsp;rockets and spacecraft orbiting the Earth that could damage the construction if&nbsp;they run into&nbsp;it. But since many bright minds are working to&nbsp;solve this problem, we&nbsp;can be&nbsp;optimistic about it&nbsp;and expect the first launch several years from now. It&nbsp;will open up&nbsp;a&nbsp;whole new era of&nbsp;space exploration as&nbsp;going up&nbsp;there will become a&nbsp;matter of&nbsp;pushing just one button. Woo-hoo!</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLWww4yhoKCgXZiur3nYqKxmqJ%2BowKquy7Jkm62ZobFuhJBuZ2tvXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

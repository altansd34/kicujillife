During a September 2016 campaign rally in Council Bluffs, Iowa, he said, “If you're innocent, why are you taking the Fifth Amendment?” The comments were in reference to the investigation into former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Though the Morning Consult/Politico survey question did not mention Trump or the Mueller probe, responses varied by party identification. Thirty-one percent of Republicans said pleading the Fifth usually means someone is guilty, with 57 percent disagreeing. Democratic voters were more closely split: Forty-two percent said it usually means someone is guilty, while 46 percent disagreed.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Responses also varied by levels of education. Forty-one percent of voters with a postgraduate degree said pleading the Fifth means someone is usually guilty, a view shared by 39 percent of respondents with a bachelor’s degree and 33 percent of voters without a college degree.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiooqR7rrvRp6Cnn5Oku7TBy61lnKedZK6zwMico56rX6u8tbHRrGSdp56peq%2Bxwp6qrJminrm6edOhoKejXaW5pq3DoqWgZaSdsm6yyJ%2BroWWZor2ttcSsZKCtmaHBbq7UrWSirF2rrrO1xKxkm7Fdpa6zwNg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

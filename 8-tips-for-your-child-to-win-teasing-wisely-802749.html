That’s because adults are unaware of it a lot of the time. Maybe your child feels scared, or they’re ashamed of being teased — and that can prevent them from telling you about it.
If your child does come to you with such a problem, we at Bright Side hope our tips will help you and your kid figure out what to do so that they can deal with it better.

Find something your child is&nbsp;really good&nbsp;at.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/565/206/5d022b50bbaa96be51fb182039.jpg><p>You can encourage your child to&nbsp;do&nbsp;more activities that they’re <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>good</a>&nbsp;at, and that will make them feel more confident. Talk to&nbsp;them about their accomplishments and tell them how good of&nbsp;a&nbsp;job they’re doing, and this will also make them feel good about themselves and help build their self-esteem.</p><p><h2>2. Tell them it’s okay to&nbsp;ask for help.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d8e/96a/1a902a511b8ebdd663cf0b41f9.jpg><p>Being a&nbsp;little kid, it&nbsp;might be&nbsp;hard to&nbsp;stand up&nbsp;for yourself on&nbsp;your own. Some children can do&nbsp;it, but some are more shy and hesitant. So&nbsp;you should teach your kid that there’s no&nbsp;shame in&nbsp;asking an&nbsp;adult for <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>help</a>, like their school teacher.</p><p><h2>3. Listen to&nbsp;your child.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/56e/e43/f727ff5150aa32c35394f33b7b.jpg><p>Talk to&nbsp;your child about what’s going on&nbsp;at&nbsp;school, and make them <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>feel</a> heard and understood. Just knowing that you’re there to&nbsp;help and support them can be&nbsp;a&nbsp;big relief for your child. Try not to&nbsp;react with strong emotions because your child might stop talking to&nbsp;you in&nbsp;fear that you’ll get upset in&nbsp;the future. Finally, <strong>don’t try to&nbsp;find a&nbsp;reason in&nbsp;your child’s behavior </strong>to&nbsp;explain why they’re being teased. It’s not their fault, and if&nbsp;you blame them, it&nbsp;will only make them more anxious.</p><p><h2>4. Name what’s happening to&nbsp;them.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/18a/0d2/1e9f5951a6beab4480ae423ade.jpg><p>Whether it’s teasing or&nbsp;bullying, <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>use</a> these words when you talk to&nbsp;your child about what’s going on&nbsp;at&nbsp;school. These words are very negative, and it&nbsp;can be&nbsp;empowering for kids to&nbsp;be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;attach them to&nbsp;a&nbsp;certain behavior, like when someone’s calling them names.</p><p><h2>5. Tell them not to&nbsp;react to&nbsp;teasing.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7c8/99c/d5106f5ba58f037b09aab8f855.jpg><p>Bullies want to&nbsp;get an&nbsp;emotional <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>reaction</a> from your kid, so&nbsp;getting angry or&nbsp;crying may only lead to&nbsp;more teasing. Teach your kid to&nbsp;try to&nbsp;ignore the teaser, as&nbsp;if&nbsp;they were invisible. If&nbsp;possible, they should also walk away. You can even role play with your child, and praise them if&nbsp;they react the way you taught them.</p><p><h2>6. Practice visualization.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/327/740/2d5d6c56618368578557b5df42.jpg><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>Visualization</a> can be&nbsp;an&nbsp;effective technique in&nbsp;helping your child handle teasing. For example, you could ask your child to&nbsp;imagine that they have a&nbsp;shield around them that doesn’t let hurtful words get to&nbsp;them. Or&nbsp;they could pretend that words are “bouncing off” of&nbsp;them every time the teaser says something negative about them. This can help them understand that what other people say doesn’t have to&nbsp;affect or&nbsp;hurt them.</p><p><h2>7. Teach them how to&nbsp;turn teasing into a&nbsp;compliment.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f7d/a45/933f4a568181aee7c89889a1ef.jpg><p>Teasers want to&nbsp;make another kid feel hurt, but they can’t do&nbsp;it&nbsp;if&nbsp;you teach your child to&nbsp;turn something negative into something <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>positive</a>. For example, if&nbsp;your child wears glasses and the teaser calls them “four-eyes,” your child could thank them for noticing the specs. This will definitely confuse the teaser, and they might not want to&nbsp;do&nbsp;it&nbsp;again, knowing that they won’t get the reaction they want.</p><p><h2>8. Tell them to&nbsp;agree with facts.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/814/0db/c0a94b58a3a5057d338b4034f4.jpg><p>If&nbsp;teasing is&nbsp;based on&nbsp;something that’s true, like that your child has a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;freckles, you can teach your child to&nbsp;just <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>agree</a> with the teaser. This doesn’t mean your kid should feel bad about themselves and let the bully win. There’s nothing wrong with having freckles or&nbsp;wearing glasses, and you should make sure your child understands that and isn’t ashamed of&nbsp;it. It&nbsp;might be&nbsp;something that makes them insecure about themselves, and it’s your job to&nbsp;convince them otherwise.</p><p>So&nbsp;if&nbsp;the teaser decides to&nbsp;attack a&nbsp;certain feature, your child will know that there’s nothing bad about looking the way they do&nbsp;or&nbsp;behaving the way they behave. And agreeing with facts will show the teaser that your kid is&nbsp;confident enough and not afraid of&nbsp;them.</p><p>Has your child ever had to&nbsp;deal with teasing? How did they react? How did you react? Did you find a&nbsp;solution to&nbsp;the problem?</p><p><b>Please note</b>: This article was updated in February 2022 to correct source material and factual inaccuracies.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZIVuwMipqmaen6d6urvUq2ScoJmhsW7AzmauoqZdqbKiv8innmavmaiyrcWMcWdrb2RufA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

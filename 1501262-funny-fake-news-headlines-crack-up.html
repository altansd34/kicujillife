However, you must ensure you don’t become a propaganda peddler. To do this, you must ensure the story you’re reading is genuine before sharing it. Here are some tips to avoid circulating fake reports.</p><h4>1. Think</h4><p class=align-left>Always think critically and evaluate the story. Does it make sense in a real-world context? Is it plausible? Does it sound too absurd to be true? Most times, if it sounds too strange to be real, it usually is.</p><h4>2. Verify the source</h4><p class=align-left>Is the report posted by a reputable source? Big media sites usually hold their reporters to higher standards than gossip sites. Therefore, if the information comes from a site known to peddle rumours, it may be unreliable.</p><h4>3. Google it</h4><p class=align-left>The easiest way to figure out whether the news is fake is to do a <a href=#>Google</a> search. Usually, true stories are reported by multiple sources. If the story you have can only be found on one site or not on Google at all, it may be fake news.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/2614dc168205e941.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Hilarious, inspirational, and powerful Robin Williams quotes</span></p></a><h4>4. Consider biases</h4><p class=align-left>Most people who share news have an agenda, and you need to gauge it. Is the news shared to polarise opinions about a certain issue? Is the source objective? Can you be objective about the topic yourself? Try to seek the same story from a source on the opposite side of the topic. Remember that headlines are often sensationalised to push a perspective.</p><h4>5. Ignore it</h4><p class=align-left>If all these checks fail, ignore the story. You don’t have to be the first one to break it to those you know. If it is a true story, it will come out anyway. You will spare yourself the embarrassment of believing and propagating fake news if it is false.</p><p class=align-left>News headlines can sometimes be intentionally misleading. Funny fake news headlines, for instance, could seem real at first glance. This is why verifying news before sharing it with others is paramount.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/03b9649c51531014.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>George Carlin quotes that will inspire you</span></p></a><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO</strong>: <a href=#>Top 50 very funny Nigerian jokes that make anyone laugh</a></p><p class=align-left>Legit.ng recently published the top 50 very <a href=#>funny Nigerian jokes</a>.

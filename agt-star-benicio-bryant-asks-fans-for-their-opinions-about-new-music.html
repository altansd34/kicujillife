The 18-year-old singer released his most recent single, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“I Can’t Dance to This,”</a> last summer.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-benicio-bryant-teases-music-with-fans-on-instagram>Benicio Bryant Teases Music with Fans on Instagram</h2><p>All three of the song snippets Bryant posted on Instagram have a great dance sound to them. He asked fans in the post’s caption, “which one is more ‘puty outy’??????” This seems to suggest that he has plans to release at least one of these tracks soon.</p><p>“You could have my body, you could take my choice / But baby, you could never, ever take my voice,” Bryant sings on the second track. On the third track, he sings, “You should never, ever dance after dark.”</p><p>Fans were divided about which song they liked the most. Some were sure they wanted to hear more of the third song, while others preferred the first two. Several people commented that they would love to hear all three of them released.</p><p>The singer even posted an Instagram story asking which demo was fans’ favorite. However, because it was set up as a quiz rather than a poll, we can’t see what the most popular choice was.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">‘AGT’ ALUM BENICIO BRYANT IMPRESSES IN CAPTIVATING ‘SAVE YOUR TEARS’ COVER</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-bryant-recently-shared-another-demo>Bryant Recently Shared Another Demo</h2><p>In December, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Bryant shared a demo</a> on YouTube for a song called “Melancholy.” The track has a slower tempo than the snippets he posted on Instagram this week. Fans in the comments shared their love for the song.</p><p>Last year, Bryant released a new single called “I Can’t Dance to This,” along with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a stylish music video</a> featuring a series of glamorous outfits. The singer has been having fun playing around with his look since he appeared on AGT in 2019.</p><p>Bryant teased on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a> in December that exciting things are on the way this year. He wrote, “ok but guys….next year……so many surprises…..” Hopefully that means fans won’t have to wait long to hear some new music releases.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Original_PriyankaChopra_Tim-P.-WhitbyGetty-Images-for-The-Red-Sea-International-Film-Festival-220x147.jpg alt="Priyanka Chopra Jonas Addresses Controversy Over Using a Surrogate for Her Baby" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>America's Got Talent</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>Benicio Bryant</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57wKCrZquklr9ursSnoJyhn2Kvs8XAp6tmmaOgwG6ywKeqZp6fp3q1tMSiqWanoJ67qrvNrGSamp%2BqwW66xLBkpq2jnrBw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

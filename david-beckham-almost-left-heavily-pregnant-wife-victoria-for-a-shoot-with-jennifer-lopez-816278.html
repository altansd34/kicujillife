At&nbsp;the time, the former Spice Girl was on&nbsp;the precipice of&nbsp;giving birth to&nbsp;their youngest son, Cruz, and the medical professionals had scheduled a&nbsp;cesarean section at&nbsp;a&nbsp;reputable Madrid hospital. The couple’s world was about to&nbsp;change drastically, and they were preparing for the joyous arrival of&nbsp;their new <a href=# title=family data-link=tag>family</a> member.</p><p>However, as&nbsp;Victoria <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>revealed</a> in&nbsp;a&nbsp;recent revelation, what should have been a&nbsp;time of&nbsp;anticipation and togetherness was tinged with discord due to&nbsp;an&nbsp;unforeseen predicament. When she told David the expected delivery date, her hopes for his undivided presence in&nbsp;the most profound of&nbsp;family moments were met with an&nbsp;unexpected answer.</p><p><h2>David told her he&nbsp;had prior engagements.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/044/d15/c776f35bda9dbdc795248f54d7.jpg><p>David confessed to&nbsp;Victoria that he&nbsp;had previously committed to&nbsp;an&nbsp;irrevocable engagement—a high-profile photo shoot featuring none other than international music sensations Jennifer Lopez and Beyoncé. This caused a&nbsp;rollercoaster of&nbsp;anger, frustration, and disbelief for Victoria, who was on&nbsp;the brink of&nbsp;giving birth and on&nbsp;bed rest.</p><p>Victoria found herself grappling with her husband’s difficult choice, especially given the imminence of&nbsp;her much-anticipated delivery. The impending arrival of&nbsp;their son already had her with physical discomfort and heightened <a href=# title=emotions data-link=tag>emotions</a>.</p><p><h2>David’s iconic photo shoot amidst Victoria’s maternal journey.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/25c/170/c4c4175fa0b3de0e27bd7b5e26.jpg><p>David Beckham ultimately managed to&nbsp;pull off both and was present at&nbsp;the birth of&nbsp;his son, Cruz, at&nbsp;Madrid’s renowned hospital. However, the course of&nbsp;events took a&nbsp;surprising turn when various newspapers featured a&nbsp;striking image of&nbsp;David, flanked by&nbsp;the iconic Jennifer Lopez and Beyoncé, under the provocative headline, “What would Posh say?”</p><p>This scenario made Victoria even more upset. As&nbsp;she lay in&nbsp;her hospital bed after a&nbsp;cesarean section, Victoria was confronted with this eye-catching image. She recalled being in&nbsp;bed after having her baby, not feeling her best, and she was shown a&nbsp;pretty photo of&nbsp;David between Jennifer Lopez and Beyoncé.</p><p><h2>David shot a&nbsp;Pepsi commercial with the singers.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7f0/b3a/5afd80538783441053cfbe785e.jpg><p>In&nbsp;the commercial, pop stars Beyoncé and Jennifer Lopez are sent to&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a href=# title=restaurant data-link=tag>restaurant</a> on&nbsp;a&nbsp;mission to&nbsp;fight some bad guys. As&nbsp;they fight, David, who was a&nbsp;bystander at&nbsp;the restaurant, watches them and then sips Pepsi after the women are victorious. David pulls and keeps a&nbsp;chair next to&nbsp;them while sexy music plays in&nbsp;the background.</p><p>“You are...” Jennifer looks at&nbsp;him and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>says</a>, but David smirkingly interrupts her and says, “Yes, I&nbsp;am.” But J. Lo&nbsp;puts David back in&nbsp;his place by&nbsp;finishing what she was saying: “...sitting on&nbsp;my&nbsp;purse.” She grabs her bag and leaves along with Beyoncé while smirking.</p><p><h2>David and Victoria’s 24&nbsp;year relationship has seen its fair share of&nbsp;rocky roads.</h2></p><p>In&nbsp;the docuseries <i>Beckham</i>, the couple engage in&nbsp;introspection regarding the highs and lows of&nbsp;their individual careers, as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;their enduring relationship, which weathered a&nbsp;series of&nbsp;infidelity scandals in&nbsp;the early 2000s. For the first time, Victoria publicly acknowledged David’s past infidelities, describing that period in&nbsp;her life as&nbsp;deeply “unhappy.”</p><p>The reported infidelities took place approximately around 2003, when David relocated to&nbsp;Spain to&nbsp;play for Real Madrid. During this time, Victoria remained in&nbsp;England with their two sons, Brooklyn and Romeo. Subsequently, two women, Rebecca Loos and Sarah Marbeck, came forward in&nbsp;the media, claiming to&nbsp;have had affairs with David.</p><p>Victoria candidly confessed, “It&nbsp;was the most unhappy&nbsp;I have ever been in&nbsp;my&nbsp;entire life.” She further revealed that during that period, she concealed her resentment and “internalized” the pain she experienced for the sake of&nbsp;David’s career, emphasizing the immense difficulty it&nbsp;posed, saying, “I&nbsp;can’t even begin to&nbsp;tell you how hard it&nbsp;was and how it&nbsp;affected&nbsp;me.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/9e8/3cf/b8100e5f95b3ed0b4fffa4a5aa.jpg><p>However, the resilient power couple managed to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>reconcile</a> and overcome the scandal after Victoria relocated to&nbsp;Spain. David shared his perspective, stating, “To&nbsp;see her hurt was incredibly difficult, but we’re fighters, and at&nbsp;that time, we&nbsp;needed to&nbsp;fight for each other. We&nbsp;needed to&nbsp;fight for our family, and what we&nbsp;had was worth fighting for.”</p><p>Since then, they have remained unwavering in&nbsp;their commitment to&nbsp;each other, even renewing their vows privately. Their family grew with the addition of&nbsp;Cruz in&nbsp;2005 and their only <a href=#>daughter</a>, Harper, in&nbsp;2011.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLGiwsidZJudk6C1ormMmqOmp6Opeq2xxa1koZ2Rq7atxYypqZ6fnpa7tXnWop2eZaaesLW70aKYZp6fp3qiedKhpqisXay2tbSMo5ynppmbsrN5y6innrJdbX53fpZxZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

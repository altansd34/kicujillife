For months, one guy’s sister-in-law had a&nbsp;favorite target: his name. What started as&nbsp;a&nbsp;harmless joke turned into relentless teasing, and he&nbsp;decided enough was enough.</p><p>My&nbsp;wife and&nbsp;I have been together since we&nbsp;were 19&nbsp;and we’re now 32. I&nbsp;met her family after we’d been together a&nbsp;year. SIL was actually the first. The very first time we&nbsp;met she blurted out that&nbsp;I have a&nbsp;girl’s name (Skye) and then proceeded to&nbsp;laugh about&nbsp;it. My&nbsp;wife told her to&nbsp;shut up&nbsp;and stop laughing. It&nbsp;didn’t bother me&nbsp;at&nbsp;all back then. I&nbsp;just laughed and told her there are plenty of&nbsp;male Skye’s around, even my&nbsp;great grandfather who&nbsp;I was partially named after. I&nbsp;was named after my&nbsp;great grandpa <i>Schuyler</i> who went by&nbsp;Sky his entire life and Sky Masterson from Guys and Dolls.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/744/987/7dee7858d885707529d0f41f30.jpg><p>I think, I can never earn over which I paid by my precedent employer, but I was wrong, world is so large to try their fate. but now I am making $52/h even more,and easily earn minimum $1300/week, on the experience everyone must try to do work online, easy way to earn, here's an example.<br>𝐰𝐰𝐰.Richnow05</p><p>So&nbsp;the first time was no&nbsp;big deal. Some people have asked me&nbsp;before if&nbsp;I felt like my&nbsp;name was a&nbsp;girl’s name and not a&nbsp;guy’s name and&nbsp;I never minded.</p><p>SIL joked a&nbsp;lot about my&nbsp;name and our kids’ names when we&nbsp;were expecting our babies. It&nbsp;got a&nbsp;little annoying but you know, I&nbsp;was able to&nbsp;brush it&nbsp;off and my&nbsp;wife would cut off her sister and would tell her to&nbsp;leave if&nbsp;she went a&nbsp;little too far which only happened once back then.</p><p>We&nbsp;didn’t see her a&nbsp;lot for a&nbsp;while but she got engaged last year and was around more, and seemed to&nbsp;have calmed down a&nbsp;lot. And now she’s having her baby, a&nbsp;girl, and oh&nbsp;boy is&nbsp;she testing my&nbsp;patience.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/4b1/3ff/36f11c54b79a54283101ad5df8.jpg><p>It&nbsp;started with her husband asking what she thought of&nbsp;the name Skye for their daughter. She joked that they couldn’t use the name because she didn’t want me&nbsp;to&nbsp;feel more like a&nbsp;girl than&nbsp;I already&nbsp;do. My&nbsp;wife told her to&nbsp;grow up&nbsp;and we&nbsp;left. The next time we&nbsp;saw her they announced Skye was the name they decided to&nbsp;go&nbsp;with. I&nbsp;said cool. SIL said she was surprised&nbsp;I was okay with sharing my&nbsp;name with a&nbsp;girl. I&nbsp;told SIL her daughter wouldn’t be&nbsp;the first and&nbsp;I wasn’t insecure in&nbsp;my&nbsp;masculinity and&nbsp;I saw no&nbsp;problem with sharing the same name girls or&nbsp;women.</p><p>The next time we&nbsp;saw them it&nbsp;was a&nbsp;joke about putting both Skye’s in&nbsp;pretty pink dresses when her daughter is&nbsp;born. We&nbsp;stayed out of&nbsp;her way for the rest of&nbsp;that visit. Then she joked that&nbsp;I had finally gotten embarrassed by&nbsp;my&nbsp;name and was using my&nbsp;middle name because one of&nbsp;my&nbsp;uncles who always called me&nbsp;by&nbsp;my&nbsp;middle name was visiting and she heard him call me&nbsp;that. More stuff like that happened and then on&nbsp;Saturday we&nbsp;were back at&nbsp;my&nbsp;IL’s house for MIL’s birthday and SIL was joking with some of&nbsp;MIL’s siblings about my&nbsp;name and she tried to&nbsp;involve me&nbsp;by&nbsp;calling me&nbsp;over to&nbsp;tell her dumb jokes.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/4c0/cfd/59ffea5a8c970e50805ebfdb8b.jpg><p>It&nbsp;finally got to&nbsp;me&nbsp;and&nbsp;I asked her if&nbsp;she had to&nbsp;be&nbsp;so&nbsp;annoying. I&nbsp;told her her how tiring it&nbsp;is&nbsp;to&nbsp;always hear her dumb jokes, which aren’t even really jokes like she claims, but insults directed at&nbsp;me. She called me&nbsp;sensitive and&nbsp;I told her she’s the person who hasn’t given up&nbsp;on&nbsp;my&nbsp;name in&nbsp;over a&nbsp;decade. I&nbsp;told her everyone gets&nbsp;it, she sees Skye as&nbsp;a&nbsp;girl’s name, but she’s not funny. SIL got mad. My&nbsp;wife told her she was about to&nbsp;become a&nbsp;mom and needed to&nbsp;listen to&nbsp;us and grow&nbsp;up.</p><p><h2>People stood on&nbsp;his side.</h2></p><ul><li>“The same joke was lame as&nbsp;hell over a&nbsp;dozen years ago and didn’t improve with age.” <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Kris82868&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li><li>“But you are doing this wrong, start going hard on&nbsp;that the baby girl will have a&nbsp;boy’s name since she going to&nbsp;be&nbsp;named after you.

Ask again after she answers, and again every time she ‘jokes’. The looks of&nbsp;confusion on&nbsp;everyone’s faces will make her shut&nbsp;up.” <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>disableddoll&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li></ul><p>Sometimes, the best way to&nbsp;handle a&nbsp;persistent tease is&nbsp;with a&nbsp;clever answer that leaves no&nbsp;room for refutation.

For those who may not remember, Klum worked with Victoria’s Secret for 13 years.</strong></p><p>The topic of Victoria’s Secret has recently went beyond viral due a popular song and a Hulu docuseries. The retail brand, marketed toward women, features various types of lingerie, clothing, and more. This brand is easily identified by their Angels (models) who typically have a petite body type. Throughout the years, Victoria’s Secret has been criticized for their lack of inclusivity.</p><p>The new docuseries, Victoria’s Secret: Angels and Demons, touches on the rise of the brand under the owner, Leslie Wexner. Victoria’s Secret: Angels and Demons mostly touches on the brand’s ties to popular sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein, who worked as a financial advisor. On top of that, the company has a dark history of sexual allegations and misconduct.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-heidi-klum-thinks-it-s-strange-that-she-didn-t-meet-any-model-in-victoria-s-secret-angels-and-demons>Heidi Klum Thinks It’s “Strange” That She Didn’t Meet Any Model in Victoria’s Secret: Angels and Demons</h2><p>Former Victoria’s Secret Angel, <a href=#>Heidi Klum</a>, admits that she’s seen the first episode of Victoria’s Secret: Angels and Demons, but didn’t like it. Within the Just for Variety podcast, the <a href=#>America’s Got Talent</a> judge clarifies that her and her husband typically don’t watch that type of TV.</p><p>“I watched that and I thought it was quite boring to be honest with you,” Klum said. “Hardly anyone I knew was on that show, I didn’t know who half of those people were.”</p><p>She noted that it was “strange” that she had never met a single model in show. Nonetheless, Klum confirms that she was asked to be apart of the docuseries, but she declined.</p><p>“If you’re going for a negative story, you’re barking up the wrong tree because I had the most wonderful time there,” she said. “They felt like my family, I travelled the world with them, made great friends… and we just had the best time together. So hearing all these stories pop up to me is just mind blowing.”</p><p>Even though Klum was heavily involved in the brand for 13 years, she claims she had only <a href=#>good experiences</a>. She expressed that she didn’t even know if the stories within the show were true when watching the first episode. Since she couldn’t connect with the storyline, she didn’t continue watching the series.</p><p>Although the Hulu docuseries has discussed the behind the scenes of working at Victoria’s Secret, Klum made it clear that she had a different experience. From there, she discussed how important body positivity has become in the fashion scene.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Original_DemiLovato_Todd-OwyoungNBC.jpg alt="Demi Lovato Kicks Off Vevo Series Through Special Live Performance of ‘29’" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57x56gnaFdoLm2uYyop56mo2LCsXnAm6aurF2dsrN51aKaraeinq60edKemqudpGK9or%2FTaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

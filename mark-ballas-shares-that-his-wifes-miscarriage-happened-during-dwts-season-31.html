In a new post, Ballas has shared that it happened while he was competing on Season 31 of Dancing with the Stars.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-mark-ballas-reflects-on-wife-bc-jean-s-miscarriage>Mark Ballas Reflects on Wife BC Jean’s Miscarriage</h2><p>Ballas posted a video on Instagram set to the song “Rainbow,” by his and Jean’s music act Alexander Jean. The song is about their miscarriage, and getting pregnant again with their rainbow baby. The video includes footage from Ballas on DWTS Season 31.</p><p>“We found out we were going to be parents a couple of days before last season of DWTS started,” Ballas wrote in the caption. “I felt a new kind of energy, excitement & creativity, but during one of our check ups we received the heavy news that our little one’s heart had stopped beating.”</p><p>Ballas said he and Jean experienced a “unique kind of sadness,” adding that it was challenging for him to choreograph and rehearse dances with his celebrity partner Charli D’Amelio. However, he said their Viennese Waltz was “cathartic in many ways.”</p><p>“Letting the balloon go at the beginning, creating a rainbow with the frame & the spinning side by side represented the chaos of those weeks as it felt like we were stuck in a tornado,” Ballas wrote of the routine.</p><p class=has-text-align-left><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=#>MARK BALLAS COLLABORATED WITH DEREK HOUGH IN CREATING MUSIC FOR ‘SYMPHONY OF DANCE’ TOUR</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-couple-is-currently-expecting>The Couple Is Currently Expecting</h2><p>Ballas and Jean announced in June of this year that they were expecting a baby together. This was before they spoke publicly about their miscarriage experience. The couple <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">shared the news casually</a>, adding it to a list of things they had been doing lately.</p><p>Later, Ballas shared how the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">couple’s friends reacted</a> to the news — including a few DWTS co-stars. D’Amelio reacted by saying, “I f*cking knew it!” New co-host Julianne Hough reacted to the couple’s sonogram images by screaming in surprise.</p><p>Ballas left DWTS after last season, but he recently returned to the ballroom to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">participate in a tribute</a> to late judge Len Goodman.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Original_WyonnaJudd_Terry-Wyatt_Getty-Images-220x147.jpg alt="Everything to Know About ‘The Voice’ Season 24 Mega Mentor Wynonna Judd" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>dancing with the stars</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>Mark Ballas</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57zJqppGWSlrmtrdJmqqGZoprAbsDHmqtmoJmoeri1xZ6qZqWZqLCivtGimKCdXZ2usbzEp5ydZZSqv6q6xmabsKyjYsCmrdKopWZrYWQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

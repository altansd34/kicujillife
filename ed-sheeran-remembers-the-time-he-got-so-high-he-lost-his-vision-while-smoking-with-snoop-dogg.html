The story began with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Sheeran</a> and his wife, Cherry Seaborn, along with her mother, attending one of Snoop Dogg’s concerts in Melbourne, Australia. Following the show, they found themselves backstage, meeting the legendary rapper.</p><p>“I remember him meeting my mother-in-law, and he was like, ‘What’s up, queen?'” Sheeran said.</p><p>Sheeran fondly recalled, reflecting on the warm welcome Snoop extended to their group. It’s worth noting that Sheeran has developed a close friendship with actor Russell Crowe, who happens to share a tight bond with Snoop, often engaging in what Sheeran called “smoke-offs” and such.</p><p>While Sheeran confessed that he doesn’t typically partake in smoking weed, the atmosphere backstage that night was undeniably enticing. He described a scene where blunt after blunt was being passed around, and he felt a certain obligation to partake in the experience if only to say, “I smoked with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Snoop Dogg</a>.”</p><p>After a bit of wine and an engaging conversation with Snoop, the moment arrived. Snoop offered Sheeran some of the green stuff, and after a bit of hesitation, he decided to give it a try.</p><p>“I just remember looking at him and being like, ‘I can’t see right now,'” Sheeran hilariously recounted.</p><p>It was a feeling quite different from his norm, but Sheeran emphasized that he wouldn’t have expected anything less from the iconic rapper. After all, it wouldn’t be a true Snoop Dogg experience without getting a bit “higher” than usual.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-ed-sheeran-gets-drunk-in-new-york-city-while-celebrating-album-s-release>Ed Sheeran Gets Drunk in New York City While Celebrating Album’s Release</h2><p>Sheeran’s wild night in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">New York City</a> didn’t stop with his memorable encounter with Snoop Dogg and Burna Boy. The singer, in a move that endeared him even more to his fans, embarked on an epic bar crawl across the Big Apple to celebrate the release of his latest album, Autumn Variations.</p><p>In a video shared on social media, Sheeran outlined his plans to hit random bars and buy rounds of drinks for strangers over a six-hour period. He greeted New Yorkers with a cheerful declaration that the drinks were on him for the night. As he made his way through the city, he chatted with fellow bar-goers, clinked glasses, and even posed for photos with staff at a Stout NYC location.</p><p>Throughout the night, Sheeran continued to spread the joy, taking the subway, playing beer pong with fans, and sharing shots with patrons at various bars. The singer’s infectious enthusiasm and generosity earned him the love and cheers of those he encountered along the way.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Original_DemiLovato_John-NacionWireImage-220x147.jpeg alt="Demi Lovato Spreads Holiday Cheer With ‘A Very Demi Holiday Special’ on Roku Channel" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57xJ1krKCVmr%2BiuoyrnKadnZeys7%2BMrZ%2BeZaSeuqZ5x55koKekYsCweceinqFlmJp6rbvSrWShoaNiw6q%2FyKilZq%2BYnrmmedKmpqShnpx6uLXToWSspp%2BkvW6wzqCeaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

The duo still earned the second-highest scores of the night, but fans nonetheless believed that they deserved their first perfect score of the season.</p><p>Good Housekeeping published the news story on November 15 and was apparently seen by Inaba. As a response, the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">DWTS</a> judge screen captured the article and went to Instagram to justify her scoring.</p><p>“I judge what is see from my perspective,” she <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class=broken_link>wrote</a>. ” If I just did what other people do, I would have zero value as a judge. But as the woman on the panel, I’m constantly made a target for blame and vitriol. I own my space on that panel AND I also appreciate the passion of our audience.”</p><p>Inaba went on to state that if she thought the pair’s routine was perfect, she would gladly give them a 10, like<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Xochitl Gomez&nbsp;and&nbsp;Val Chmerkovskiy. For those who missed it, two danced tango to “I Wanna Dance with Somebody” and earned a perfect score.</p><p>“I did not think those dances were “perfection.” Be mad at me,” she wrote. “I can handle it. I’ve been judging for 32 seasons. But then you better be voting.”</p><p>The next episode of Dancing With The Stars will be A Celebration of Taylor Swift. The six remaining couples will perform to the pop star’s biggest hits from different eras.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-she-appears-to-throw-shade-at-harry-jowsey>She Appears to Throw Shade at Harry Jowsey</h2><p>Among the dancing pairs that made it to the Top 6 were reality star <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Harry Jowsey</a> and first-time pro Rylee Arnold. Sadly though, the Whitney Houston Night saw fan-favorite Barry Williams and partner Peta Murgatroyd leave the show.</p><p>Saddened by the news, Inaba took the time to bid her farewell to The Brady Bunch star.</p><p>“The man, the myth @thebarrywilliams. You are such a shining star. It’s been a joy to watch you perform each week. You showed us what a true entertainer does when he turns on his star power. I’m sure&nbsp;@theflorencehenderson&nbsp;would have been proud,” she wrote.</p><p>In the comment section of the post, fans expressed their sentiments for Williams’ elimination. One comment read, “I am so mad that we keep losing such great dancers and Harry’s still on there.”</p><p>Apparently, DWTS fans noticed that Inaba liked this comment. A reddit post contained the screenshot of the interaction, with the comment “liked by author.”</p><p>Some fans are thrilled to see that the judge thinks Jowsey should go. However, others believe the Inaba’s act was unprofessional.</p><p>“I’m sorry this is extremely disrespectful and takes her judging integrity away. She should not be judging if she feels this way about a certain contestant. Judges are supposed to be unbiased,”&nbsp;a person wrote.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Original_TheVoiceCoachesSeason24_Trae-Patton_NBC-220x147.jpg alt="‘The Voice’ Season 25 Premiere Date Announced for Next Year" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>carrie ann inaba</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>dancing with the stars</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57wpqpq6GVYq6vuoyipZqakWKxprLEp5usZZiav26%2FwqipoqaXYrOzu8xmpq6sopa0prCMna6tq12brq%2B%2Fjg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

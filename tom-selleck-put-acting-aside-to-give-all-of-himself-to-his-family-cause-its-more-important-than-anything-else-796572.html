So in 1983, <strong>when he and his future wife met</strong>, he was already an extremely popular actor. He was filming a movie in London, and apparently <strong>became obsessed with a certain musical</strong>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ba0/b5a/94d58556199f447dc9f6a67899.jpg><p>“He&nbsp;kept telling me&nbsp;how great Cats was,” <a href=#>said</a> his movie co-star Jane Seymour. “I&nbsp;thought it&nbsp;was good, but&nbsp;I couldn’t see going back a&nbsp;dozen times.” Turned out, it&nbsp;wasn`t as&nbsp;much the musical itself that fascinated him, as<strong>&nbsp;it&nbsp;was one of&nbsp;the dancers</strong>, Jillie Joan Mack. They had dinner one night and <strong>became a&nbsp;couple</strong>.</p><p><h2>Away from prying eyes</h2></p><p>It was in 1987 when Tom and Jillie got <a href=#>married</a>. At that time, Tom was still starring in Magnum, P.I. He wanted to keep unwanted attention away from the ceremony, so <strong>he made it as private as possible</strong>. His brother Bob <strong>even gave fake names</strong> – Tom Jenkins and Suzie Mark – when he made the wedding arrangements. And the real identity of the groom and the bride were revealed to the officiating minister only minutes before the service.</p><p>Moreover, the wedding pictures were taken on a Polaroid, so that it would be impossible to make negatives and leak them to the press. As for Tom and Jillie, here's what Rev. Immel, the pastor of the church where the wedding took place, <a href=#>said</a> about them: “<strong>They were both nervous, like any other couple</strong> about to get married. He was very concerned that the service be heartfelt, very concerned for her, that the service be meaningful. <strong>He is a very warm, caring man</strong>.”</p><p><h2>The moment Tom`s life changed</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5ef/51c/56fcd9501cbbcc976b8b8f13e9.jpg><p>In 1988, <strong>Jillie gave birth to a girl </strong>named Hannah. Before that, Selleck had an extremely successful series, worked 90 hours a week, and starred in movies from time to time. But after the birth of his daughter, he decided it was time to <strong>dedicate more time to his family</strong>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/3a7/9bd/a0a03e598988a387071ed5cbaf.jpg><p>“I&nbsp;quit Magnum to&nbsp;have a&nbsp;family. It&nbsp;took a&nbsp;long time to&nbsp;get off the train, but&nbsp;I try very hard to&nbsp;have balance, and this ranch has helped me&nbsp;do&nbsp;that,” he&nbsp;<a href=#>said</a> speaking about where he&nbsp;lives.</p><p><h2>The secret to a happy marriage</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5f9/9a8/9c4bf35a2f9ecae990eae4ba23.jpg><p>Tom and Jillie <strong>have been married for 32 years</strong>. All this time, he's continued putting his family first. He hasn't quit acting completely, but he doesn't do it as often as he did in the 80s, so that there's enough time for him to spend with his family. He <a href=#>said</a>, “It’s important to nurture your <a href=# title=marriage data-link=tag>marriage</a>. I think wanting time away from work has been good for that.”</p><p>Who is your favorite character played by Tom Selleck?

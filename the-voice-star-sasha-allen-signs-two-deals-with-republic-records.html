The 20-year-old added that he actually signed two record deals, including one with his father Jim Allen.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-sasha-allen-announces-he-signed-with-republic-records>Sasha Allen Announces He Signed with Republic Records</h2><p>Sasha started his announcement video with a clip of him from January, sharing that he was about to call his school and drop out to focus on his music career. As he said, “I’m gonna be a successful musician, and let the universe do what it wants to do with me.”</p><p>He added that he would revisit the clip in a year to “see what I achieved.” Sasha then interrupted the clip to share that he looked “like a literal f*cking piece of feces in that video.” After dragging himself a bit more, he eventually dropped the news that he is “now signed to Republic Records, so it did f*cking work.”</p><p>Sasha kind of buried the lede there, but he elaborated in the comments to say that he actually signed two record deals, one as a duo with his dad, and another as a solo artist. As he wrote in the caption, “the last year has been wild.”</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=#>‘THE VOICE’S SASHA ALLEN SHARES NEW SONG REACTING TO GUN VIOLENCE IN AMERICA</a></strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-jim-and-sasha-made-it-to-the-voice-semifinals>Jim and Sasha Made it to The Voice Semifinals</h2><p>Sasha and his dad Jim were a duo on The Voice Season 21 last year.

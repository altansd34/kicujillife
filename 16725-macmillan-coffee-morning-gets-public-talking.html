The concept is simple - the charity asks individuals and organisations to host coffee and cake sales where people are encouraged to make donations.</p><p>YouGov CharityIndex data underlines how much of an important set piece the Coffee Morning is for Macmillan - both in terms of driving donations and encouraging people to talk about it.</p><p>The early signs are that this year's event was a success. Firstly, Macmillan’s Word of Mouth Exposure score (that measures whether a respondent has talked about the charity with family and friends in the previous two weeks) rose to its highest point since the turn of year. It currently stands at +12, suggesting that the Coffee Morning got people talking about the charity.</p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/new20macmillan20WOM.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>This increase is mirrored by a rise in its Ad Awareness, which looks at whether someone has seen one of the charity's adverts in the past fortnight. Macmillan’s score improved by 5 points over the last month, again meaning it is at its highest level in 2016.</p><p>The event has been partnered by Marks & Spencer for a number of years, and our data indicates that this relationship helps contribute to the event's success. YouGov Profiles data shows that M&S customers are more likely than the population as a whole to not just like Macmillan, but also to have donated to it in the last 12 months.</p><p>Of course, while the charity will no doubt be pleased that people are talking about it, the real marker of such a campaign is an increase in donations.</p><p>CharityIndex measures whether people have donated to a charity in the past 12 weeks. Over the last month, Macmillan’s score rose by 7 points.</p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/New20Macmillan20donations.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>The World's Biggest Coffee Morning campaign indicates how successful Macmillan Cancer Support is at implementing effective local and grassroots events. The key to this is the simplicity and accessibility - it is easy to stage and take part.</p><p>What’s more, it shows how powerful it can be for a charity to be associated with a major annual flagship event at the same time each year, and how it can make people discuss the charity and the event and dip into their pockets, too.</p><p><a href=#><strong>Find out more about YouGov's CharityIndex</strong></a></p><p>Image PA</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmixn6q0sMKNnKZnrZtksLC60q6knqpflr%2B1tcKlnKxnYWuEc4GMppicpZmhuaK6jJymn56Vmnquu9GnoKefXZyytb%2BMqaybpJmYerWty6Sgp58%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
